			<p> The single S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martha Calvert who
				departed this life March 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1816,
				has left the following short account, which she dictated Sept
					13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1813. I was born Oct 19th
				1743 in Idle, in my 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year I moved
				with my parents into Pudsey, they belonging to the B<hi
					rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript"
					>n</hi> as soon as I was old enough took me to the Childrens
				meeting, where I remem ber as a very little Child being told to
				pray to our Saviour to wash our hearts in his blood, and when I
				came home, I often went into a corner, and repeated these words
				as well as I could. March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756
				I was added to the great Girls Choir, which day proved a great
				blessing to me, and from that time I felt an earnest desire to
				come to live in Fulnek, this favour was </p>

			<p> granted to me May 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1759. I was
				now very happy and comfort able, felt quite at home, and thought
				I wanted nothing more. The 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
				Nov. the same year I was rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi
					rend="superscript">n</hi> with 26 others; having made no
				previous application for this favour, I was much struck when my
				name was read in the Caple, but I prayed fervently to our
				Saviour that his aim might be obtained with me. Jan. 18<hi
					rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 I was spectator at the H.
					Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> from this time till the
					29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug. the same year, when
				I had the favour to enjoy this sacramental food for the first
				time, was a period which I shall never forget, when I learned to
				know my own depravity and sinfulness, and our Saviour manifested
				himself to </p>

			<p> my heart in a particular manner as my Redeemer. I learned to
				know that without him I could do nothing, which proved a good
				and holesome School to me, and after this I went on for sometime
				in a hap py course. In my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year,
					B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nitshman spoke individually
				with our whole Choir, it has always been impressed on my mind
				how fer vently he recommended me to our Saviour. After the Synod
				in 1764 was a very searching time in this Cong<hi
					rend="superscript">n</hi>, which was also to me of great
				importance, I sensibly felt how short I fell of what I ought to
				be, which humbled me at the Lords feet to seek grace and pardon,
				and when the whole Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> had missed
				the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for 3 successive times,
				the feeling which pervaded us all when we again had the </p>

			<p> favour to meet at the Lords table words cannot express. To say
				much more concerning my pilgrimage here below, I am not able,
				nor has any thing very striking accur red, my Saviour has dealt
					<del>has</del> with me as a kind and tender Father, lead me
				on by degrees as I was able to bear it, and kept his faithful
				hand over me in many trying hours of temptation. When I
				therefore now look back how I have spent my time, my only plea
				is; &quot;God be merciful to me a sinner.&quot; I find abundent
				cause to thank and adore my kind Redeemer for all his love and
				faith fulness towards me in every respect; in my imply he has
				blessed me that I have wanted for nothing and often when I was
				sweeping the Sleeproom, and being with </p>
			<p> my Saviour alone, I have had many happy hours, when I could
				simply lay my case before him. Now when I am not able to do any
				thing, the time will now and then apear long to me, but I pray
				to him to strenghten my faith and confidence, and to prepare me
				for his heavenly kingdom, I am very thankful that I am able to
				attend the meetings, which prove a great comfort and refreshment
				to my heart. Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> did not
				think when she dictated this, that she still should remain so
				long in this vale of tears, her patience was often tried, but
				she prayed earnest ly to the Lord for help and sup port; as long
					<del>as long</del> as she was able, she faithfully attended
				the Chaple, where she found food and </p>

			<p> nourishment for her hungry soul and with great thankfulness for
				the blessings she now injoyed she often lamented, that she in
				former days had not made better use of those priviledges, she
				often said, that during her late affiliation she was in a close
				School, where our Saviour by his good spirit pointed out to how
				many things, which led to deep self examina tion; and here she
				experienced now, that he who wounds, can also heal the sins with
				soul, and speak pardon and peace to the troubled mind, and
				thanked the Lord with many tears, for what he had done for her.
				In July last year, she was seized with a paralytick strook,
				whereby she was deprived of nearly all the use of her limbs,
				this was </p>

			<p> an other hard trial, but the Lord gave her grace to bear this
				and other afflictions with patience, tho&apos; she often longed
				for the time to be with him; she would frequently say, o what
				happiness awaits me, when I shall see my Saviour face to face, O
				what endless mercy, that he will receive such a poor and worth
				sinner as I am. The 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Last. she
				was according to her desire blessed for her departure and com
				mended to the friend of her soul, and the 15<hi
					rend="superscript">th</hi> early in the morning it pleased
				our Saviour to call her hence, to rest with him for ever more.
				Aged 72 years. 5 Months. </p>
