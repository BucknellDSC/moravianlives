					I was born in holbeck in the parish of Leeds in the year of our
					Lord 1717 May ye 18 of very dear &amp; tender parrents who were
					prebytouryons but I was baptiz&apos;d by a Minister of the Church
					of England on account of their thinking of my soon departing
					this life Else I was educated in the Religion of the presbytierens
					When I was a little Child and my mother Dressing of me
					She generaly told me I was now going amongst other Children
					to play, and I should perhaps hear them say bad words
					and Charg&apos;d me to take care I did not so, for it was a bad thing
					and this had such an Impression on my mind that It never
					left me, no not when I was amongst the Children, but always
					remain&apos;d in my mind that it was such a bad thing to do so 
					from 7 years old I often went into a Corner to pray, that god
					would have Mercy on me and often wept before him, when I 
					had the Smallpox it was thought by every one who Saw me
					that I should have gone home, then being but 7 years old, but
					my mother on her knees often pray&apos;d the Lord to Spare my Life
					howsoever I might be disfigur&apos;d with them I used to ask my
					mother what one might do to be Saved, and she told me I must
					pray to the Lord and beleive on him and I should be Saved
					and I asked her if one could not be sure she said no she beleiv&apos;d
					not, but one must pray to him and beleive in him in my young
					years I came into Several dangers of my Life Especially once
					when I was drawing water at a deep Well, the Roulor which 
					winds up the Rope came out of the frame, and it with the Swape
					went all into the well and pulled me on to my knees after it
					I Liv&apos;d Still with my parrents in a private manner kept no 
					Company and at nights when work was done I used to go into the 
					feilds and pray that ye Lord would have Mercy on me, I often
					Sigh&apos;d &amp; thought O that I was sure of my Salvation till I was
					about fourteen years of age Some neighbour Girls about that
					time was throng in gotting fine Cloaths I also fell in with them

					with great eagerness I tought now I will have some pleasure
					of my Life Living a Religious Life &amp; takeing care as much as
					possible to avoid every thing that was bad thinking I might
					by that means injoy some pleasure of my Life and go to heaven
					as others did before I was sixteen years of age I met with a young
					man who told me, he had pitch&apos;d on me for his wife, I told him
					I was too young, he told me he would wait till I was older I 
					found my self thereby drawn in to something, which when my
					dear &amp; tender parrents as well as my Sister <add place="above">heaped of </add>they did all in their
					power to brake it off out of tender love to me this greiv&apos;d &amp; troubld
					me very much for some years I could not got it out of my mind, nor
					could I take any pleasure in any thing as before I had many good
					offers but being disapointed once it set me quite against it when
					I had gone now some years in this disatisfied Condition I heard
					that Mr Ingham was going about to preach the Gospel, I went
					to hear him, and he preach&apos;d concerning the forgiveness of sins
					which was so much to me that it directly eas&apos;d me of all my
					former trouble &amp; uneasiness I came home weeping all the way
					for 3 mile which I had never gone before nor did I know the way
					till then my Dear parrents were much affected seeing me in such
					a weeping Condidition I pray&apos;d our Saviour to give me my parrents
					and the whole Family, which he did directly, I went to the meetings
					and often wept after the forgiveness of my sins &amp; the full assurance
					of it in my heart it was often to me in the midst of my prayers
					as if the Person above mention&apos;d stood before me &amp; I was praying
					to him this troubl&apos;d me very much I strove &amp; pray&apos;d with weeping
					to get him out of my mind at Last I turn&apos;d to our Saviour &amp;
					with great Egarness &amp; said to him Lord Jesus thou canst help me
					take this away from me which hinders me from seeking thy rich
					forgiveness for the sake of which I wou&apos;d part with every thing
					else I found he did help me and took it quite away where upon
					I thought he can do all things for me being Sure I could no

					by no <add place="above">other</add> means have got rid of them I pray&apos;d heartily to him, for the
					full asurance of the forgiveness of all my sins, which I could no
					Longer be satisfied about, at the same time hardly knowing what
					I wanted forgiving, but at once it came into my mind, that I had
					never Lov&apos;d God in my Life from thence flow&apos;d all my sins which
					I ever had done or said, then I went on mourning night &amp; day
					thinking I must be Lost, &amp; wishing myself any sort of creature
					but what I was, I work&apos;d at the same time among a company of 8
					or 10 very wicked people in a shop, who spent their time in Singing
					songs or Swearing the day long, while I sat weeping &amp; praying
					they thinking that I to be sure was going of my Senses, at that
					time in the midst of all this company, it was to me as if I saw our
					Saviour Cover&apos;d all over with Blood &amp; wounds, standing before me
					who told me that he had dy&apos;d for me &amp; received all those wounds
					in his Sacred Body on my account, my heart was filld with rapture
					&amp; I wish&apos;d that the whole world coul&apos;d Join with me, to praise him
					I went a qarter of year without ever losing this impression, and
					feeling I then got, after this I begun to feel my self very poor, and
					left that feeling of Joy which I had, this Causd me to mourn, &amp; think
					what I had grow&apos;d my dear Lord with about this time dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bohler
					came into those parts who preach&apos;d our dear Saviours death &amp; wounds more
					clear then ever I had heard before, by this I learn&apos;d to know that I should
					remain poor and Low in my self, &amp; go to him in his wounds &amp; Blood
					Just as I was, then I begaun to reason over myself that I had not known
					his wounds &amp; blood aright, &amp; could not be satisfied about till I had
					Learn&apos;d to know them better so I wept and pray&apos;d so long before 
					him till he again satisfied my poor heart, &amp; afresh let me feel
					the power of his wounds and Blood here upon I ask&apos;d my dear parrents
					to forgive me every thing where with I had grow&apos;d them &amp; thank&apos;d them
					at the same time for Learning me to read which struck them very
					much but I was glad to read the scriptures which were a very great
					comfort to me, &amp; the dear Holy ghost pointed out to me thro them
					How I should go on, When I heard of the Brns Settling in yorkshire

					my heart was very much rejoiced B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dicky Uttly spoke to me
					about writing to the Congregation for reception but I thought
					my self too poor &amp; mean to think of such a favour but I thought
					if it was our Saviours will y he had Calld me I wou&apos;d write to
					the Congregation in his name which I accordingly did and
					was re&apos;d on Christmas day old Stile the impression I then
					got continu&apos;d with me wherever I went of I was as if the spirit
					of the Congregation rested upon me, and I went on happilly till
					the next communion day, when I <add place="above">was</add> admitted Candidate, what I then
					felt I shall never forgot, tho it is beyond description to describe
					the feeling of my heart on that Ocassion the next time
					I injoy&apos;d the Communion with the Congregation, to my deepest abasement
					for the first time to are abiding Blessing &amp; Comfort to my poor
					heart, I Lived still with my dear Parrents at Holbeck &amp; being
					of a Sickly constitution, &amp; timrous Disposition, often came with 
					difficulty&apos;s, to my dear fullneck, but my dear &amp; faithfull
					Saviour graciously preserved &amp; help&apos;d me thro all, till at last
					being not able to walk so far I with my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> mov&apos;d into Pudsey
					While I remain&apos;d in holbeck it was my greatest pleasure with my
					Dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to Entertain the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; Sisters who came to the
					Soceity meetings kept then at our House &amp; as far as laid in
					my power to serve them since I have removd to pudsey I have
					injoy&apos;d more of the Congregation meeting to a real Blessing
					for my heart for which and all other favours rece&apos;d by me
					from him &amp; his dear Congregation I am truly thankfull
