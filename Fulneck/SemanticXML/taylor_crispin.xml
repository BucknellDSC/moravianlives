					<p> Crispin Taylor, was born in Wyke in the Parish of Birstall April y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 26, 1698, and lived with his Father, who learnd him the Trade of a Shoemaker,
						till April 1722, being then 24 years of Age he was married to Mary Wilkinson, who is his present Wife, and had by her 9 Children, four of which are left behind, the other five
						went home before him. In his married State he approved himself a carefull, lo ving father and a tender Husband.</p>
					<p> When Mr. Ingham first began to preach here about, he soon went to hear him, and his heart was touch<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> by the holy Ghost in the first Sermon he heard.
						From that time, he sought all Opportunities to hear the Gospel of our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviours Death and Attonement After the Societies were settled here in
						Yorkshire, and put under the Care of the Brethren, he and his Wife upon their Request were also taken in amongst them, which was a great Satisfaction to both, and proved a
						Blessing to their hearts, which made them some time after very desirous to be ta ken into the Congregation and to be in a closer Con nexion with the B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi>. He therefore spoke with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Toltshig about it, expressing his hearts desire to be wholy our Saviours Oct the 1<hi rend="superscript"
							>st</hi> 1748. he had after many earnest and repeated Requests this favour granted him <add place="above">&amp; his Wife</add>to the great Joy of his heart, for it proved
						an extraordinary Blessing to him, so that his Wife and all about him saw a visible Change, he being so chearfull, lively and happy, as they never had seen him before. This
						continued with him. He was a simple and up right heart, and when he heard any one reason about <note type="catchword">things</note>

					<p> things, he used to say: What is this to us, the Lamb will know it best; and again: Let us wait for our Savi ours time, his time is allways the best. Soon af ter this his heart
						secretly longed to partake of The  Corpse and Blood of Jesus in the Sacrament, when  unexpectedly he was sent for, and told by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> that  our
							d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviour; who knew his hunger would soon  accomplish his desire, and should therefo be confirmd and blessed, which made his heart very glad
						and more attached to the Wounds of Jesus. March the 24 1749. he partook of the holy Communion for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> time when his Soul and Body was so afected
						and pe netrated thro &amp; thro with the martyrd Corpse &amp; blood of Jesus, as he could not express it with Words. He was so happy in his heart and felt such Blessings that
						he scarce knew, what he eat of drank, or how he walkd or workd for many days, and this sound he felt ringing in his ears perpetually: My flesh is meat indeed, and my Blood is
						Drink indeed. And indeed it proved itself to him real Life, and  Meat and Drink to his Heart. When his Wife was concernd, that she did not partake with him of the  same
						Priviledge, he behaved very tender towards her, and comforted her, saying: Have a little Pa tience, for the Lambs time is the best.</p>
					<p> Several years ago he had got a Surfeit by heating  himself with working over hard, which for three years past, has at times troubled him much with a severe Costiveness and Pain
						in his Bowels. About 10 weeks ago he was taken with it again but continued chearfull and quite resigned to our Sa viour; B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee went to see him,
						and when he  <note type="catchword">loo-</note>
					</p>
					<p> looked at him, he found him so solid and groun ded, and with such a Sinnerlike Shame, as he never be fore had observed in him, So that coming home he said  to his Wife: Crispin
						Taylor ripens fast for Eternity.</p>
					<p> Oct The 28. He grew worse and could work no more. But soon after was obliged to keep his Bed. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee visited him, and asked him, whether he
						thought he  should be soon well again? He answered softly (for he feard his Wife would hear him and be grieved at it) but yet very chearfully, and said: No, I shall go to my
							D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviour, and further being asked: Whether he should like to go home, he answered O yes, with all my heart and Soul; I would go this night, if
						it pleased him, but yet I&apos;ll wait till he calls me, for his time is the  best. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<add place="add">&amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add> Hauptmanns soon after came to Scholar to speak with the Communion B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi
							rend="superscript">rs</hi>: and calld on to see him, of which he was exceeding glad and spoke of it with great Joy. Some days after B Oxlee came to see him again, and found
						him asleep, and as he had had no Sleep for many nights, because of his extreme pain, he would not have him disturbd. But after he got wake his wife told him of it. O sayd he:
						Why didnt you   wake me, for I love the Brethren <add place="above">with my whole heart</add> and am very glad of their Visits, especially him, who lives so near me, and I am
						allways better after I have Seen any of them. Nov: the 12 B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee visited  him again; and being asked to pray for him, he  asked Crispin, what his
						heart desired most, at which he looked up, smiled and sayd: my hearts  Desire is, to be with my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saviour. He spoke but low, but one could
						understand and feel, what he said and according to his earnest Request <note type="catchword">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></note>

					<p> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee recommended him to the Lambs outstrechd arms and bleeding heart with an inexpressible feeling. Nov: 19 he grew weaker and weaker and being
						asked: If he would not take any of the Do- ctors Medicines &amp; he hereupon answered quite loud, saying: It signifies nothing, what I take, and you may give me, what ye will,
						I shall go nevertheless go to my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hauptmann has been to see me, and he has give
						me some thing, which is better, then all the Doctors Stuff in the World, meaning the Sacrament of the Corpse and Blood of our Savr. After that his pains in creased more and
						more, so that he could talk no more, but yet was sensible at the time. Nov. the 29. notwithstanding his being exceeding weak, yet his Disorder, was quite changd from a Severe
						Costiveness to a real Purging, so that there seemd to be some hape of his Recovery. They begd much that B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hurlock might come and see him, which he
						soon after did, but found him in such Cir cumstances, that he rather despaired of his Re covery, But he and the rest of the family were much pleased, that he came and saw him.
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee, who came to see him, asked, how he found himself, he said: my Brother, perhaps I shall not go yet, alltho I should like it, if my dear
						Lamb would call me this night, for I sometimes think it long, before he fetches me, but he knows best. He was very resignd and notwithstanding his violent pain, he sufferd, yet
						he bore it pa tiently and Scarce ever complaind. Dec. 12, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oxlee visited him again and found him excee ding chearfull. He laid hold of his hand,
						and <note type="catchword">pulld</note>
					</p>
					<p> pulld him down to him to kiss him. He told him that he took it very kind that he came so often to see him and thankd him many times for it. He was then a little easier. He was
						told that next Sunday would be the Communion at Grace Hall, of which he was very much rejoiced and glad. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hauptmann came to see him few days
						after, and spoke with him about the insuing feast of the Corpse and Blood of our Husband. He found him very chearfull &amp; happy and very hungry after the Par ticipation of
						the blessed Communion with the Con gregation, The 15. Dec. being Fryday at night he alterd very mich for the worse in an instant. His Wife perceiving it, asked him, if she
						Should call his Children; he said: Yes. When they came in, he was in great pain, notwithstanding that he calld them to him, and began to speak tenderly to them, as well as his
						painfull Body and faulte ring tongue would admit of. He prayd them and even charged them each of them with dying Words and weeping Eyes, that they should give themselves and
						cleave to the crucified Saviour, and then rea ched out his trembling hand to bless and assure them, that if they should cleave to their Saviour he would bless them and bring
						them through, and You Betty with all your Children, meaning his Daughter, who is married. His poor weeping Wife, feeling &amp; seeing that he was going, said: Will you go &amp;
						leave me behind? O says he, cleave to the Saviour, cleave to the Savoiur, and I will Soon See you again. What, when I come to him? Ay, ay, cleave to the Saviour and he will
						bring You thro. He gave her his Hand to confirm it with <note type="superscript">His</note>

					<p> His Pains growing stronger, he Seemd as if he would Ture, to stretch himself. which was into the ever lasting Arms and pierced heart of Jesus, where he now rests Sweetly and
						safely, secure and free from Sin and earthly Misery.</p>
					<p> F and askd his Wife to assist him, which she willingly did: He afterwards seemd as if he would go to Sleep His Wife not hearing him breath took, a Candle to look at him, and
						found, that he was really gone without the least Sighs or Struggle, looking ex ceeding sweet and Smiling, and thus he happily departed </p>
