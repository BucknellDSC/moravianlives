               <lb/>in the third Year of my Age I came in the

                  <lb/>my dear Parents very emphatically remembred to me

                  <lb/>Mercy on me anew, that I may feel his Nearness again.
                  <lb/>Hereby I experienced how soon our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. is inclined
