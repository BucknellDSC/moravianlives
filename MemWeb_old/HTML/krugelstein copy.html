         Krügelstein by Maiden Name Gold of Moravia who departed in

         Grace &amp; Mercy the Lord bestowed upon her during her Life.

      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 1</h4>
      <p> I was born July 10th 1713 at Zauchtenthal near Fulneck in
         Moravia. Already in my second Year I experienced a grac- ious
         Preservation of God. My Mother used to gather Grass for her Cattle, &amp;
         generally took me along, &amp; laying me once down near a Tree, a Wolf came,
         placed himself close by me, &amp; smelt at me. My Mother felt at once very
         anxious, &amp; turning about to look for me, she saw the ravenous Beast with me.
         She then run hastily towards me, and the Wolf went a few Steps back, so that she
         could take me. My Parents reveiwed me anew as a Gift of God, and thanked him with
         Tears for my Preservation, for they were both devout People; and having looked
         upon me from my Birth as a gracious Gift of God, they endeavoured to educate me
         according to his Mind, wept &amp; prayed often to God in my Behalf &amp; took all
         possible Pains with me. In my 5<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year I became much
         concerned about regaining a Fellowship with God through Jesus Christ, because I
         had heard my Father say, that we had lost it by the Fall of Adam, but that the
         second Adam Jesus Christ had procured it again through his Sufferings and Death.
         The Holy Ghost took

      <p> me upon this Occasion into a particular School , stirred up in my a Confidence to
         God, so that I could converse with him quite familiarly, &amp; preserved me in
         many Dan, gers from Deviations, giving me an Admonition when I was not on the
         right Track. He at the same time wrought in me a Fear of falling into Sin, and
         granted me the Grace to speak uprightly with my Parents about every Thing. By
         which means I escaped many Temptations of the Enemy of my Soul. 
      </p>
      <p> In the Year 1724 there was a great Awakening among the Children in
         Moravia. I heard that we must get a new Heart if we will
         be saved, &amp; that God alone was able to give it. This occasioned new Perplexity
         in me, seeing that I was deficient herein &amp; I was much troubled. I
         at the same Time looked out for some Companions, to whom I would discover this my
         Concern, &amp; our Saviour gave me eight who had the same Mind; we often went into
         hollow Roads and Bushes, where we were alone, &amp; wept and prayed for the new
         Heart. A Hope was also kindled within me, that I should become a Partaker of it,
         tho' I felt myself very unworthy. 
      </p>
      <p> In 1727 the Persecution in Moravia rose to
         that Pitch that Orders were given, that everyone should swear Allegiance to the
         roman catholic Religion. My Mother who had a faithful Heart to our Savior, would
         &amp; could not do it, but 
         <h5>resolved</h5>
      </p>
      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 2 (right)</h4>
      <p> resolved rather to emigrate. She asked me whether I would accompany her? I
         consented directly, &amp; the Concern of our Heart to see our Souls saved, was so
         great, that nothing could detain us. 
      </p>
      <p> While these Things were going on, my Mothers older Brother John
         Nitschman arrived with us from Herrnhut, who
         emigrated before us, to him we discovered our Intention , &amp; he being willing
         to accompany us, my Father made directly secret Preparations for our Departure.
         And thus we left our House &amp; Mother Country June 23<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rd</sup> 1727, &amp; set out for
         Herrnhut My  |: her
         Mothers Brother Melchior Nitschman :| who was in Jail at
         Kunewalde |: who at last died in Prison at
         Kremsir as a Martyr :| and to whom I brought from time
         to time what he stood in Need of; to him I had discovered our Intention, shortly
         before, &amp; had taken a very moving Leave of him. He recomended us there to the
         Protection of the Lord, and said to me during a particular Sense of the Peace of
         God: " I am sure I shall find thee once among the Number of those who are with the
         Lord " On our Journey we were several times in Danger of our Lives, &amp; besides
         this had to suffer much Distress, Hard ships &amp; Anxiety. But our Savior helped
         us, so that we arrived safe, chearful and happy July 2<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">nd</sup>. at Berthelsdorf to our unspeak- able
         Joy. The next Day we went to Herrnhut, &amp; were welcomed
         with much Affection by the little Congregation there. But we had to live yet for
         some Time in Berthelsdorf. 
      </p>
      <p> My Concern for my Salvation increased here more &amp; more. I yet remember that I
         felt something extraordinary during the

      <p> great Comunion Aug. 13<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. 1727, and I
         begged the Lord Jesus, attended with many Tears to
         think also of me. I went here to School to Mr. Krumpa, who
         often told us that he loved the Lord Jesus, because he had shed his Blood for us.
         This excited in me a Confidence to our Savior that he probably had also shed his
         Blood for me, &amp; would have Mercy upon me. At the Time when in
         Herrnhut the great Awakening among the Children began,
         he asked once his Scholars: Whether they also would love our Savior &amp; give him
         their Hearts, so that He might wash them wih his Blood? With those who expressed a
         Desire for it, he made a Covenant, to love Him above all Things who loved us
         first. Upon which Occasion He in whose Eyes we were precious walked certainly in
         our Midst, &amp; none of us knew what had hap, pened unto us. It occasioned a
         great Joy in Herrnhut, that our Savior had also graciously
         visited the Children in Berthelsdorf. We wept &amp; prayed
         together during an inexpressible Feeling of the Nearness of Jesus. 
      </p>
      <p> My Parents moved soon after to Herrnhut, where we had it
         outwardly very pinching &amp; hard. But I must say to the Praise of our Savior,
         that I could suit myself pretty well into poor Circumstances, for I had left my
         Mother Country with no other Intention, than to be satisfied with Bread and Water.
         But the H. Ghost begun a new Work in me. I learned to know our Savior as the
         Friend of poor Sinners; he forgave me the Sin of Not believing in Him and His
         Merit, &amp; showed me my 
         <h5>Name</h5>
      </p>
      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 3 (right)</h4>
      <p> Name engraven into his Hands. Now happy did my Heart feel when he cleared it up
         to me, that His Sufferings, his Death &amp; Bloodshedding had also happened for my
         sake, &amp; that I was his Property. I could not sufficiently contemplate our
         Savior in his Sufferings Beauty, whereby all external Troubles &amp; Difficulties
         were made quite easy to me. In January 1729 I was to my inexpressible
         Joy admitted to the H. Comunion with the Congrn. I then made |: as it was the
         Custom at that Time :| a public Confession before the Cogrn. that I would be, long
         with Soul &amp; Body to my Redeemer &amp; devote to Him Life &amp; All. In this
         blessed Enjoyment of our Savior, I went on during a particular Care of the never
         to be forgotten Dis- ciple of the Lord, Count Zinzendorf, who
         took much Care &amp; Pain with me, till 1732 when i came to
         Ebersdorf, to take Care of some young Countesses. Here I
         was to my Heart somewhat removed from the Simplicity in Christ Jesus. But our
         Savior, according to his great Faithfulness, did not suffer me to be plucked out
         of his Hand, but renewed in me that Mind to devote myself to him , &amp; to look upon it as my destined Share to
         follow him, in Poverty &amp; Reproach. By Occasion that I was joined in H.
         Matrimony Sept. 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. 1733 with that
         Servent of Jesus my late Husband David Kriegelstein, I re-
         newed the Covenant with our Savior to be his with Soul and Body, and begged Him to
         be with me, &amp; lead me by his Hand, till he would happily take me home. He did
         not last long, before we had to

      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 4 (left)</h4>
      <p> experience Poverty &amp; Reproach of various Kinds. Till 1736 we had
         the Care of the Girls  in
         Herrnhut, &amp; assisted in the Work of the Lord &amp;
         the Congrn. and particularly the married Choir. In June the same Year
         we went to Ronneburg in Wetteravia, &amp; from there to
         Frankfort upon Mayn, &amp; with these Journies we made
         the Beginning of a poor Pilgrim Life, having often at our Nights Lodgings neither
         Bed Clothes above nor under us; and in the latter Place, there arose soon a
         Persecution against the Brethren, so that we were obliged to leave the City. We
         then stayed with the Pilgrim Congrn. at Berlin, &amp;
         afterwards in Wetteravia till in Oct. 1738
         when we set out on our Journey from Marienborn to Livonia
         with a Visa to go, agreable to our Call, through Russia to Persia. Our
         Savior blessed our Abode in Livonia to many Souls, &amp;
         granted us the Grace to testify with a hearful Heart to People in high &amp; low
         Rank what Jesus Blood each do on Sinners base. I shall never
         forget it, what a powerful Grace ruled at that Time among the Estonians &amp;
         Lettonians. 
      </p>
      <p> In 1740 we returned to Marienborn, where I
         enjoyed a very blessed Time. The Year following |:1741:| we resided
         with the Pilgrim Congrn. at Geneva and Montmirail and in May 1742 we
         went with Count Zinzendorfs Family the second Time to
         Livonia. But we found it this time very different from
         the Time we had been there before; because a great Enmity had arisen against the
         Brethren &amp; which increased more &amp; more, and in April 1747 the
         Beginning was made to put the Brethren in Prison.

      <p> The Brn. Gutslef and Helderhofwere
         first brought as Pri- soners to Petersburg, and in
         June following also Br. Fritshe and my
         Husband. Though there was a very strict Prohibition, that none of the Brn. &amp;
         Srs. should be suffered either to leave the Country or come into it; I ventured it
         however to travel with my Son 31/2 Years old, whom our Savior
         had given me in Livonia, &amp; a Foster Daughter
         Mary Jacob, to Herrnhut. Having no
         Passport I could not travel on the public Roads, &amp; as besides this 6000
         Russians had formed a Line from the River Dina to the
         Boundaries |:it being then War:| there was according to all human Appearance no
         Probabi, lity to come through. But our Saviour who was so inexpressibly near to me
         at the time when my Husband was taken Prisoner so that it was as if he spoke
         personally with me, comforted and sup- ported me powerfully. I simply followed his
         Leading, and he brought me at last through many Dangers, round about Ways,
         Wildernesses &amp; Morasses to Angermünde in Curland to the
         Rev. M. Laskiell where I was richly strengthened &amp;
         refreshed. They also cared for it that I safely arrived at
         Königsberg, from whence I was accompanied to
         Herrnhut, where I arrived in Aug. the same Year
         |:1747:| For Joy that I was in my dear Herrnhut,
         I forgot for some Time all my Griefs &amp; Sorrows, and Count
         Zinzendorf took a fatherly Care of me, so that I would speak fully
         with him about all my Circum- stances. However the Grief about my dear Husband, of
         whom I would get no Account to be depended upon, returned soon, &amp; besides this
         I had many laudy &amp; heavy Hours, so that it was a Wonder that I was so safely
         delivered of my Son John Friederich

         moved to Lindheim in Wetteravia to have the Care of the
         Childrens , where I had the Pleasure to
         recieve the first Account to be depended upon from my dear Husband, by a most
         affectionate Letter of his own Handwriting. In 1751Br. Risler came to Marien, born from
         Petersburg, &amp; brought me by Word of Mouth good Ac,
         counts of my dear Husband, &amp; offered me to take me along with him. This Offer
         I received as out of the Hand of our Savior. And Aug. 1<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup>. I sat out with him &amp; his dear Wife
         thither with the Blessing of Count Zinzendorf and the Brn and Srs. My four Children I
         re, comended to the faithful Heart of Jesus &amp; the Congregation, &amp; my Heart
         was then so disposed: I know that I am Jesus Pro- perty; of his Flesh &amp; of his
         Bone, &amp; shall remain his eternally tho' I am very poor and wretched. I go with
         that Mind to my dear Husband to do that which our Savior would have me to do, and
         I shall continue sitting at the Feet of Jesus. The 29<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. the same Month we arrived at
         Petersburg. But I had to keep myself at first very still
         in Br. Koehlers House, till he had procured Leave for me to
         come to Petersburg. Besides this I grew so sick, that I
         could not think otherwise, but that I should depart this Life without having seen
         my Husband. Add to this that I could not even let my Husband know anything of my
         Trouble, because whatever I wrote to him I had to regulate so that all might read
         it, because Leave for my Journey to Petersburg was not yet
         procured. This was a very hard Trial 
         <h5>for me</h5>

      <p> for me, &amp; yet but a small one in Comparison of those to come. I spent my
         sleepless Nights in Conversation with my only Friend, wetted my Pillows with
         Tears; Jesus Perplexities, his merit- orious Tears, &amp; nightly Prayers, were of
         great Service to me, they strengthened &amp; comforted me, so that I could
         childlikely resign myself to him, &amp; believe that if I even should go home to
         Him without having seen my Husband, that he however would be my most faithful
         &amp; never failing Friend, who knows best for what Reason he has brought me
         hither. Br. &amp; Sr Risler
         &amp; Ferbers visited me as often as possible, &amp;
         refreshed my needy Soul, which I shall acknowledge with Gratitude as long as I
         live. I however recovered again &amp; Sept 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>.
         |:1751:| being our Wedding Day, Br. Koehler made me
         the Pleasure &amp; led me in- cognito with his Family to the Brethren in Prison.
         This was indeed a great Joy to see each other again after so long a Time. In
         Oct. 1751 I obtained at last Leave to move to my dear Husband, to
         whom Leave was granted to move with the Brn Helterhof &amp;
         Fritshe |:Gudslef was already gone to our Savior:| into
         the hired House of Sr. Helterhof. This was a great Refresh-
         ment for my sick &amp; weary Heart. But even this could not come to pass without
         Trouble, for there came soon Counter Order that I should not yet move to my
         Husband, &amp; I had to live 6 Days with Br. and
         Sr Risler in a private Manner. However we had afterwards
         the Pleasure to live together for some Time, which was effected by the
         inexpressible Pain Br. Koehler took, who for our sake had to
         put up with much Vexation &amp; Reproach. 
      </p>
      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 6 (left)</h4>
      <p> But our Joy did again not last long, for in May 1752 our Brn had to
         return again to the Catacombs |: subterrarious
         Vaults:| on account of the Misbehaviors of another Prisoner. We Sisters viz.
         Sr. Helderhof and I had however Leave to visit &amp; to
         nurse them. Nov. 2<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">nd</sup>. the same Year they
         and we came into great Distress by Water, the Nerva swelling to such a Degree that
         the Water rose in the Catacombs up to the half of the Windows, &amp; in our House
         so that I stood up to the Belly in Water, &amp; thus had to retire to the upper
         Story of the House, without being able to put on dry Clothes. To my great
         Surprise I continued well &amp; healthy &amp; the next Morning I
         could go to the Prisoners, who to save themselves had got up on the Wall, where
         they had to continue 2 Nights &amp; one Day in the open Air in great Cold, Snow
         &amp; Rain. 
      </p>
      <p> We brought them &amp; also to other Prisoners some Refreshments to make them
         warm; but we could not come to them without great Danger of our Lives, the Stream
         having torn the Bridge leading to the Fortress in such a Manner that scarce a
         Soldier ventured to cross it. Similar Inundations happened the 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. and 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. of
         Nov. but against which better Precautions were taken. Dec. 30<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. we had again the Joy to obtain Leave to
         live together; Secretary Na- bakof having procured free
         Lodgings for us in the Suburbs, in which we could live very comfortably. 
      </p>
      <p> Oct. 3<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rd</sup>. 1753 our Savior gave me a
         little Daughter, &amp; this our little Fellow Prisoner was baptized by the
         Rev. Mr. Buzow Minister of the great lutheran Church in
         Petersburg, during a very blessed Feeling of the near
         Presence of our Lord. She was

      <p> called Johanna Christina. The Minister recomended her with
         particular Affection to the Preservation &amp; Protection of our Savior here in
         this strange Country; Many Tears were shed upon this Occasion. 
      </p>
      <p> We lived yet sometime very chearful &amp; in Sickness, &amp; the va- rious
         Frights, which never were wanting, were so much the easier to be born, because we
         could still live together. But still in the same Year it pleased our dear Lord to
         take our faithful Friend Secretary Nabakof out of this World.
         He believed in Jesus. During the Direction of his Successor, who did not know us,
         we were first more confined, and in the Night of the 28<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. of Aug. my Husband and the Brn
         Helterhof &amp; Fritshe were fetched &amp;
         carried away, without knowing why &amp; whither. I myself had to assist in putting my Husband who
         was sick unto Death into an open Boat, &amp; see him thus carried away on the
         Water in Storm &amp; Rain. We two Sisters spent the Night weeping, &amp; when the
         next Morning Enquiry was made of those who had carried them away, whether they had
         been brought; we were still more frighted by fearful Accounts of their Fate. At
         last we received the joyful News, that they had been brought to their former
         Prison, &amp; that we might visit them. We hastened directly to them, to bring
         them some Refreshments. This proved to be a great Joy to see those yet alive whom
         we believed dead. To my great Astonishment I found my Husband a little better,
         tho' sometimes so weak, that I went away in the Evening with the Thought of having
         seen him the last Time. I spoke confidently with our Savior about there
         Circumstances, and He convinced me that it was according to His Heart 
      </p>
      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 7 (left)</h4>
      <p> &amp; Mind, that they were Prisoners here in Petersburg;
         my Husband was also convincedof it, &amp; we encouraged each other often to be
         resigned to our Fate, &amp; happy &amp; chearful in the Near- ness of our dr.
         Lord, and to have all our Troubles sweetened by the Converse with Him. Leave was
         indeed given us to visit the Brethren in the Day Time as often as we pleased; but
         there were always People who made it very difficult, you often
         impossible for us, &amp; thus we got one Fright after another. And besides this
         our Savr. took in 1755Sr. Helterhof to himself, &amp; thus I was quite alone in the
         House with my Child. Not understanding the russian Language, &amp; being obliged
         to leave my Child alone in the House, when I had to go out, &amp; being in
         continual Danger of a Surprise by Robbers; the Brn. &amp; Srs. in
         Petersburg advised me to make Application to the Congrn for somebody to assist me, &amp; I got Br.
         Grumberg who took a most faithful Care of me &amp; my Child. I had
         also taken a russian Girl out of Compassion , who got a Love for our Savior, &amp;
         when I went out |:for I had to carry to the Brn. all their Necessaries:| she
         entertained my Child with Singing Verses. Once in Winter 1757 when
         going over the River Neva, the Ice broke under me, &amp;
         the Stream carried me a Piece along, so that I must have been drowned, if the Eye
         &amp; Watchman of Israel had not so faithfully preserved me, But I became very
         sickly afterwards. In this Distress I prayed fervently to our Savior, to grant me
         the Satisfaction, to nurse the three Prisoners

      <p> as long as they stood in Need of Care &amp; Nursing in this Vale of Tears &amp;
         Trouble, though it should even be done in ever so great Weakness. And this He has
         done graciously &amp; helped me so, that through it seemed sometimes as if the
         Tabernacle would break, the Brn.
         suffered however no Want. At this Time I had a particular Confidence in conversing
         with our Savior. One of these Conversations in Oct. 1758 was very
         imppressive to me, when I spoke fully with him about my whole Course of Life,
         &amp; was richly comforted about all my Mistakes. In Febr. 1759 we
         were at last set at Liberty, but ordered to go to Casan. We were 5 in Number, viz.
         my Husband, the Brn. Helterhof
         &amp; Fritshe &amp; I &amp; my Child. On this Journey new
         Trials came upon us. The Brethren could not bear the violent Shaking of the
         Waggons, on the bad Roads &amp; Causeways, made of round Wood, after sitting so
         long in Prison, &amp; they had to suffer much, particularly my Husband, who had
         always been weak. Add to this the Fright of being attacked by Robbers on the other
         side of Moscovia, who most cruelly beat our Guards; he be-
         came quite enervated, &amp; a mortal Sickness befel him, so that he lost his
         Speech. His Mouth was at were burnt up, &amp; his Tongue withered, I had not even
         as much as a Drop of Water to refresh him. I often begged our Savior to comfort
         him with his Thirst. Besides this we saw nothing but inexpressible Difficulties
         before us. The People did not like to have any Dealings with us, because we had
         Soldiers with us, so that we often did not know, where to get a Morsel to eat,
         particularly as it was Lent Season, wherein the Russians are very

      <p> strict. At last we arrived at Maram upon the
         River Ocke, where we met with more friendly People,who
         looked upon &amp; loved as par- ticular good Christians &amp; Children of God,
         &amp; served as as well as they could. We felt well among these People, &amp; I
         believe they will be counted among those to whom Jesus will say: I was sick and ye
         have come to the highest Pitch, for he could not even move his Tongue, &amp; lay
         quite speech &amp; senseless. The Creature begun now to plead with the Creator,
         &amp; I was quite at a Loss what to think or say, when I considered that the
         Departure of my Husband was so near at Hand. But then in my greatest Trouble,
         &amp; when I was at the Brink of Despair, the loving Heart of Jesus interfered,
         &amp; set Bounds to the raging Waves; for our Savior gave Strength to my Husband
         that he in some Measure recovered, so that, to my great Surprise he spoke fully with me about our Course hither to, &amp;
         particularly about this Journey, whereas he could not speak one Word before. He
         said among the rest: Be not discouraged about these Circumstances; thou knowest
         that our Savior already in 1738 gave Directions, that we through
         Russia should go to , but the Enemy has thrown some
         Obstacles in the Way, so that it was stopt, about which I never could be
         satisfied, but now our Savr., with whom I have kept up on un, interrupted
         Conexion, amidst my Weaknesses of Soul &amp; Body has satisfied me about it, by
         this that the russian Government itself sends us now thither, so that we however
         shall see Asia, &amp; sojourn in it. My great Weakness is a natural Consequence of
         the great &amp; sudden 
         <h5>Alteration</h5>
      </p>
      <hr></hr>
      <h4>Ann Krügelstein memoir, page 8 (right)</h4>
      <p> Alteration of my Way of Life hitherto, &amp; belongs to the final Com- pletion of
         my Sufferings. And it is a Grace to me, that also in Sufferings I am made
         conformable to my best Friend. Our Savior well certainly restore my Health so that
         I shall reach the Place of our Destination. In Casan I
         shall probably go home to our Savior but thote wilt go again to
         the Congrn. with thy Child, &amp; with all our Children
         enjoy there much Goodness &amp; Mercy from our Savr. We then pursued our Journey
         &amp; my Husband recovered more &amp; more, yet I had to care for &amp; nurse him
         like a Child. At last Apr 27<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. 1769 we
         arrived at Casan, having been three times in evident Danger
         of our Lives, after we had entered the Borders of Asia. In
         Casan we found it better, than we expected. The People
         there showed much Love &amp; Respect to us, and even the Governor himself behaved
         very friendly towards us. I often begged our Savior to give us at least one Soul,
         where our Testimony of him might find Entrance, &amp; it was not a small
         Satisfaction to us, that we could brave the Labour of the H. Ghost, with some
         Russians and Turks. I wept &amp; prayed much both on the Journey &amp; particu-
         larly here in behalf of the Inhabitants of this Country, &amp; I must own, that
         when I spoke right confidently with our Savior about it, he gave me a very
         gracious Look, &amp; the Assurance into my Heart that a Light will yet spring up
         in this Country. Nov. 23<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rd</sup>. 1760Br. Fritche departed this Life happily, &amp; on the

         Age, &amp; entered into the Joy of his Lord, &amp; everlasting Freedom &amp; Peace
         after a Captivity of more than 13 Years. I mentioned it directly to the

      <p>Commander Plaisin, who out of Love to my Husband, procured a
         Passport for me from Petersburg, that so I might safely
         come thither. And though the Roads were very unsafe, &amp; much was heard of
         robbing &amp; murdering, I nevertheless ventured it on our Savior, to whose Care
         &amp; Protection I had quite anew surrendered myself; and it did not come into my
         Mind that any Evil could happen unto me. And my Eyes flow with Tears of Gratitude
         &amp; Abasement, when i consider how evidently our Savior has cared for me, &amp;
         what Wonders of Grace &amp; Mercy he has shewn unto me. Just when I was going to
         set out on my Journey &amp; had called upon to accompany me , it was ordered so,
         that a Libonian Captain Durnstern had to travel the same Way;
         he took me gladly into his Company &amp; we set out Jan. 21<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup>. 1761 from Casan.
         My taking Leave of Br. Helterhof who of the three captive
         Brn alone was left, is known to our Savior, &amp; not
         to be expressed in Words. The Captain shewed in expressible Love &amp;
         Faithfulness to me &amp; my Child, &amp; more than once ventured his Life for our
         sakes particularly Jan. 29<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. when it had
         the Appearance as if we should find our Graves in the River
         Wolga; for the Ice begun to sink, &amp; to get Holes, &amp; some of
         the first Sleds fell already in the Water. We could not think of turning or
         evading it, for on one Side was already upon Water above the Ice &amp; on the
         other was a very steep high Shore. In this Distress came the Captain through the
         Water to us, broke off Branches from the Bushes which grew along the Shore, &amp;
         covered the Holes with them, &amp; himself led our Horses over them. And thus with
         the Help of God, we were de- livered out of this Distress, in which we had been
         from Noon till towards 
         <h5>Midnight</h5>

      <p> Midnight. The Captain cared for me &amp; my Child throughout the whole Journey
         like a Father, did not only pay all Expences, but let always one of his Servants
         stay with us, &amp; when distressing Circumstances occurred he himself with some
         others hastened to our Assistance. He everywhere gave us out to be his Relations,
         &amp; took Care of our Things in the best Manner. I brought my Child very sick of
         the small Pox to Mascovia; but as the Captain would take me
         with him as far as Novograd. I set out with my Child sick
         as it was, &amp; our Savior prevented all ill Consequences. But in
         Novograd where our Road parted, the Captain was very un,
         easy about me, particularly as he had heard of his Servants, that my Drivers had
         evil Designs against me, as soon as we should be alone. But in this Perplexity, we
         met quite unexpectedly, &amp; to our Joy, as russian Lieutenant of the
         Guard Milkanoth, who was a good Friend of the Captain, &amp; also
         knew Br. Koehler in Petersburg very
         well, who was also travelling thither. I took Leave of my Bene, factor with a
         thankful Heart, and he delivered me to the Lieutenant as his Relation, &amp;
         begged him to pay strict Attention to our Things &amp; Drivers, &amp; not suffer
         them to stay behind with me, saying: All you do unto her I shall look upon as done
         unto myself. The Lieutenant executed also his Commission in the best Manner, and
         our Savr. brought us safe &amp; well to PetersburgFebr. 24<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. 1761. O how glad &amp;
         thankful was I to be again among Brn. and Srs. But I met again with Difficulties
         on account of my farther Journey, everybody representing it to me as impossible to
         get a Passport. But according to my Custom I re- comended also this Affair to my
         dear Lord, &amp; begged him to take it in Hand himself &amp; execute it. And this
         he did also to my great Joy &amp; Abasement, for he directed Matters so, that I
         got a Passport under

      <p> the Name of the Ambassador of Saxony. Having now rested here a little after so
         many sleepless Nights, Dangers, Troubles &amp; Distress, I sat out from
         Petersburg by Water, with my little Daughter, whom I had
         preserved as a particular Gift with all possible Care &amp; Faithfulness,
         accompanied by Br. Kryman, May 18th. 1761. The
         taking Leave of the Brn. &amp; Srs. here was very painful on both Sides. Towards
         Evening we set Sail, but we soon got a Storm, which was against us, &amp; a total
         Eclipse of the Moon rendered it quite dark, so that we saw nothing before us but
         our Destruction, particularly as our Vessel was too deeply laden, &amp; the
         Neva being in that Place full of Sand Banks. 
      </p>
      <p> We returned in great Danger &amp; sailed again the next Day for
         Cronstadt. Here I had again new Troubles, but our Savior
         helped me thro', &amp; we could now pursue our Voyage without any Hindrance. I now
         looked once more at the Land of my Troubles with Tears in my Eyes, &amp;
         recomended it to the faithful Heart of Jesus. So as the faithful Eye &amp;
         Watchman of Israel watched hitherto over me on my Journies, so I experienced it
         also on my farther Travels by Sea &amp; Land. It was as if the Arms of my dear
         Savior enclosed me around, especially at Lüneburg on the
         rest of my Journey. During the Time of our Abode at
         Lüneburg which lasted 10 Days there were every Day such
         violent Storms of Thunder &amp; Lightning as no, body remembered ever to have
         seen, but when we sat out the Weather was fair &amp; pleasant. And tho' that whole
         District was then sur- rounded with War, we saw nothing of it, &amp; arrived at

         Herrnhut to our inexpressible Joy. Ah! what Tears of Joy

      <p> and Thankfulness trickled down my Cheeks that my faithful Savior brought both me
         &amp; my Children to the Congrn. I devoted it, &amp;
         myself anew to Him as his "Property." Thus far her own Relation. Her Heart was
         filled with Thanks &amp; Praise, that our Savior had accomplished her ardent
         Desire to be again in the Congrn at Herrn,
         hut, so that she now would enjoy a happy Sabbath in the Congrn, &amp; with her Children. July 21<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup>. she moved into the Widows House &amp; was
         made Use of as an Assistant, till 1764 when she moved to
         Marienborn, &amp; 1766 to
         Zeyst with the then Directory. In 1768 she
         went to England with Br.
         &amp; Sr. Boeler &amp; Count Dohnas,
         &amp; the Year following again to Herrnhut. In
         1770 she got a Call to go with Br. and Sr. de Treyden to
         Curland, &amp; though she found it hard to leave
         Herrnhut, she however accepted it with a willing Heart.
         Sr. de Treyden gives the following Account of the Abode
         &amp; Service of our late Sister with them: "We were very thankful to our Savior
         that he would give us this, through many heavy Trials approved of Hand Maid of his
         to go along with us; both to be a Partaker of our Joy &amp; of the Troubles which
         befel us. She assisted us faithfully with good Advice and actual Help, &amp;
         proved parti- cularly a real Comfort &amp; Benefit to me after the Departure of my
         dear Husband. Her cordial &amp; confident Connection with our
         Savior, alleviated all Difficulties to us both. She took a very near &amp;
         affectionate Share in all my Circumstances. She experi- enced also here in Curland
         various Trials, but her Endeavours for the Good of the Souls
         were attended with Blessing, the Fruits of which will shew themselves in Time to
         come. Both high

         inexpressible Faithfulness to me &amp; my Child till to her
         End. May our Savior reward her now richly for it. He alone can comfort me about
         the Loss of this venerable Mother, &amp; in- timate Friend of mine. Sept.

         spoken fully with our Savior about her whole Course of Life, &amp; had got the
         Assurance, that he would soon take her to himself. She added: Ah how sweetly will
