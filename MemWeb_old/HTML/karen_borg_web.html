      <p>Memoir
         Of our beloved Sister Karen Borg, who
         departed to the Lord at Gracehill,
         March 8 1847.

      The vice of that blood which<br />
      Flowed from thee Saviour!<br />
      Which cries aloud wherein I tread<br />
      Thy tears for my ransom - all <br />
      Plead in my favor, <br />
      Nor call for vengeance on my head. <br />
      No! grace &amp; free mercy thy looks impart,<br />
      And this day refresh me taken my heart.<br />
      In spirit thy once bleeding hands I embrace<br />
      Which bear me triumphant<br />
      Though all my distress.</p>
      
      <p>This verse contains in it the history of
         my course on earth, regarding which I have
         nothing remarkable to record; but I would
         acknowledge the mercy of our faithful Friend
         and Saviour, who sought and found me,

         me his poor child.
         I was born May 18 1768 at Christiansfeld
         in Norway, where I was carefully bro
         up by my dear parents till my 10<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year.
         I remember where I was only 7 seeing
         them weeping, and when I inquired
         the cause, my Brother told me that it
         was because they were thinking of our
         Saviour, and she discoursed to me on
         his love to children and to poor sinners
         in a way which made a deep impression
         on me. _ June 2 1778 my dear Mother
         brought me hither to Christiansfeld for
         education. I felt overjoyed on my arri-
         val here, though I could not tell why,
         but I have since thanked the Lord with
         tears a thousand times for choosing
         me out of the world and bringing me
         to his people. I soon felt myself at
         home with my companions, and was
         very happy. The children's prayer class
         were days of especial blessing to my
         heart. Febr 16 1780 I received permis=

      <p>year was permitted added to the choir
         of Girls. I felt much on leaving the chil-
         dren's choir, in which I had enjoyed so
         much of my Saviour's nearness, where
         we brought him our united supplica-
         tions, or when I retired to weep for him
         in private. July 9 following, I was rec<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup>
         into the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>; but having to wait some
         time for admission to the Lord's supper,
         I could not understand it, as I had
         made it a subject of frequent prayer,
         and hitherto the Lord had always heard
         me. On reflection, I said it was to teach
         me not to trust in my own strength,
         or diligence, or virtue, or good educa-
         tion, and to wean me from the danger-
         ous self complacency which I cherish-
         ed on account of these things. And
         my faithful Saviour succeeded in
         convincing me that I was possessed
         of nothing good.
         When I attained to the first enjoy-
         ment of the Holy Communion, Oct 10
         1782, I felt how blessed it is to be
         poor in spirit, and to receive his mer-

      <p>-its as a fit of undeserved grace. I
         begged him to preserve me in this frame
         of spirit, and to grant me low thoughts
         of myself at all times, seeing that to
         poor needy sinners he was so gracious.
         In this disposition my days passed
         happily away, until my innate de-
         pravity began to awaken within me.
         Hitherto I had often acknowledged
         myself a sinful creature, but now
         I felt that from the heart proceed
         wil thoughts, and sorely was I tor-
         mented with un-christianlike
         thoughts, so that I had no rest day
         nor night. To disclose my trouble to
         others, would I thought inevitably
         deprive me of their good opinion;
         my confidence in my Saviour also
         vanished, and I knew not how to
         bear myself for distress of mind. In
         this pitiable condition, I shut my-
         self up in a room alone - it was a
         sacrament-day Dec 24 1785, threw
         myself at my Saviour's feet and

      <p>begged him with a flood of tears to
         have mercy on his wandering child,
         and give me to feel the pardon of my
         sins. And never shall I forget, I trust,
         the look of grace with which I was cheer-
         ed on this occasion lay my crucified Re-
         deemer. It was as though he said to me
         himself "I have heard thy prayer and
         seen thy tears - thou art mine."
         "Might all his loving heart but see,
         And know his bowels of compassion
         To sinners, straying carelessly,
         Or such as mourning seek salvation."
         From this time I was like one
         new-born; I felt my short-comings in-
         deed very frequently, but the Lord inspir-
         ed me with faith in Him, so that I
         could lay all my wants before Him.
         I was also enabled to speak confiden-
         tially with my choir-laborer, which
         was a great care to me. I now went
         on my course, not indeed without va-
         riation, yet always finding comfort
         and peace at my Saviour's feet. And his
         patience, mercy and compassion are

      <p>more than everything to me.
         May 4 1786 I was received into
         the Sgle. Srs. choir, on which occasion
         I had an inexpressibly blessed percep-
         tion of the Lord's nearness, and gave
         myself up to him anew as his eternal
         property, imploring him to keep posses-
         sion of my heart, that all his thoughts
         of peace with me might be attained.
         Towards the end of the same month,
         I had the pleasure to see my dear father
         here on a visit, and many a pleasing
         recollection of the conversation I had
         with him on spiritual subjects, is im-
         printed on my memory. July 2 in the
         same year, I received a proposal to as-
         sist as teacher in the Girls' school, which
         caused me many heavy hours, feeling
         as I did my insufficiency and inex-
         perience, and knowing that there were
         others more suitable for the situation.
         The Lord however enabled me to take
         the proposal as from His hand, and
         helped me graciously through all dif-
         ficulties. It is true I had much to

      <p>learn, and this mere school for my
         heart caused me many a sleepless
         night. All however worked together for
         my good, and calls for my humble
         and heartfelt gratitude. My inter-
         course with the dear children whom
         I cordially loved, and whose love I felt
         in return, was very pleasant to me,
         and the Lord was after in our midst
         in our social worship. When things of
         an unpleasant nature occurred, it was
         my prayer, that if I could do no good,
         I might at least lay no stumbling-block
         in the way of these little ones. _
         The early part of the year 1789 was a
         peculiarly blessed season for my soul,
         my mind being much occupied with
         the thought of going home to the Lord.
         This idea was greatly strengthened,
         when, in the beginning of April I
         had an attack of spitting of blood.
         Many were the hours of blessed in-
         tercourse with the Friend of my soul,
         which I enjoyed at this period. Thank
         to Thee my faithful Saviour, for the manner

         own me, thy poor child: thou hast
         followed me with love and tender mer-
         cy from my youth up; be my confidence
         still, and suffer not my faith to fail,
         till the happy hour shall strike which
         summons me to meet thee, when I
         shall say: "Here comes a sinner who
         would fain Thro' the Lamb's ransom
         entrance gain."; I would rather have
         gone home at this time than recovered,
         and both mind and body felt the effects
         of this illness for a long period. In the
         following Sept. several things combined
         to weigh down my spirits, and every one
         thought I was in a decline. As I kept
         my trouble to myself, the burden was
         the heavier, and I began to doubt my
         Saviour's willingness to help. But he
         appeared again to comfort me and put
         my anxious grieving to shame. I was
         especially cheered at this time, by the
         privilege which he vouchsafed[?] me,
         of joining in the celebration of the 16
         of Sept. with the servants of our Church.

      <p>Thus far was written Nov. 1789.
         Jany 1 1798 was a very blessed New-
         years-day to me. The Lord gave me to feel
         his forgiveness of all my transgressions
         and mistakes so sensibly, that my heart
         overflowed with gratitude and joy, and
         I devoted myself to his service amongst
         the little ones with new courage, heavy
         as my situation had been in many
         respects in the past year. On the 12 I
         received a call to Ebersdorf as Co-labourer
         of the SgleSrs. choir, which, notwith-
         standing my insufficiency, I ventured
         to accept in reliance on the Lord's help,
         which I had experienced on many a 
         former trial. On casting a retrospective
         glance on the 20 years which I have
         spent in this dear Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>, I cannot but
         adore my Saviour with the deepest hu-
         mility and gratitude for his great long-
         suffering, patience and faithfulness.
         The love and friendship testified towards
         me by my sisters, notwithstanding
         all my failings, humbled me greatly,
         and made the parting painful. Nor

      <p>could I have the dear children commit-
         ted to my care without a pang. My sin-
         cere wish is that they may all prosper
         for the Lord, and yield themselves to
         him as his property. On my dear fa-
         ther's happy depature at Christmas
         1794, my dear mother removed hither 
         to my no small gratification and joined
         the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>. I had now to quit her and
         all my dear friends, leaving Christans-
         feldMay 5, and on the 30 of the same
         month, I arrived in Ebersdorf. I felt
         a strange sensation on catching a first
         view of the place in the distance, but
         I said "Dear Saviour, thou hast called
         me hither, and thou must help me.
         Thou best knowest my weakness,
         I know none here but thee alone, and
         thou permitted me to cling to thee."
         Notwithstanding my fears, I was
         received with much love. Previous
         to my being introduced to the choir,
         I cast myself at the feet of Jesus
         and besought him with many tears
         to be my Guide, and enable me to walk
         before

      <p>before him in lowliness and humility.
         I then entered the choir-hall, and never
         shall I forget what I felt on being blessed
         for my office. It was as if our Saviour
         himself laid his pierced hands upon my
         head, and gave me his benediction.
         What rendered it still more impressive
         to me was, that it occurred just at the
         entrance upon Passion week. I soon felt
         at home in this dear peaceful settlement,
         and spent 3 years very happily. The La-
         borer and Warden of the choir were two
         old experienced sisters, whose counsel and
         assistance were of essential service to me.
         Their love, as well as the love and confi-
         dence of my sisters generally, made my
         abode here very pleasant.
         March 30 1801 I received a call to
         Fulnec, which was again a hard trial
         to me. Gladly would I have declined it
         but I did not feel at liberty to do so. I
         therefore accepted it in implicit reliance
         on my gracious Lord. In May I received
         an invitation to be present at the Synod
         of the Brn's Church, which was to be held

         new grace and encouragement for
         my weak faith.
         On the 24 of the same month, I
         took farewell of my choir, dividing with
         them the cup of covenant, and next
         day proceeded to Herrnhut. Sept 3 I
         pursued my journey in company of
         Br. and Sr. Moore, and arrived in FulnecOctober 3.
         Thus far our late sister continued
         her memoir in German, though of the
         introductory verse she has furnished
         both the original and the version. Sever-
         al other verses are interspersed in the
         memoir, which show her ready talent
         in this species of composition.
         She continues in English as follows:

         Calling to mind this day, that it is
         10 years since I arrived in this place,
         various thoughts occupy my mind.

      <p>I sink down abased before my Lord and
         Saviour, for numberless proofs of his love,
         faithfulness and forbearance, which I
         have experienced in many ways. The first
         year I spent here appeared very heavy in-
         deed; everything seemd so different to
         what I was accustomed, and not know-
         ing the language, was altogether a heavy
         task. However my best Friend did not
         leave me nor forsake me, but lent a
         gracious ear to all my wants and com-
         plaints. In Oct. 1802 I was afflicted
         with an epidemical fever, and so ill,
         that little hope was given of my recovery.
         Though I had no clearness that I should
         go to my dear Saviour, yet I wished
         for that favor to see him face to face,
         and felt happy in the thought of leav-
         ing this world. But it pleased him to
         restore me again, and I found much
         reason to thank and adore him for
         his paternal love and care, which
         was made manifest to me.

         50 years ago. This surely was a day
         which the Lord himself made; the
         blessings we enjoyed will always be
         remembered with gratitude by
         those who were present; and I can
         truly say it was the first day I felt
         quite at home here.
         In 1803 and 1804 it pleased our
         Saviour to call home to himself
         both my fellow-labourers. This was

         Sept. 26 1816 I received a call

         I believe we all felt on that occasion
         what is expressed in the hymn:
         "Blest be that sacred covenant love to."
         Dec. 10 1816 I arrived safe in Grace-
         hill after a troublesome journey and
         voyage, wind and weather being
         very severe. I was received in love,
         and soon found myself at home;
         but finding the house in a very
         distressed state with regard to ex-
         ternals, it would often sink my
         spirits; but thanks to my dear Savi-

         also in this respect has helped us
         far above all that we would ask

      <p>It was only on the 22 of last
         month that our dear sister was
         taken ill, having probably caught
         cold on the preceding day where
         she was walking in the burial-
         ground lane. She was soon obli-
         ged to keep her bed, though no
         immediate apprehensions were
         entertained as to the result. After
         a whole week however had elap-

         the malady, filled our minds with
         anxiety, and she herself began to en-
         tertain the hope that her Saviour
         was about to call her to himself.
         On the 2 of this month, she quo-
         ted the well known lines of C. Wes-
         ley: _ "O could I catch a smile from thee
         And drop into eternity."

      <p>She said she should be glad to go
         to him if it were his pleasure. In reply
         to a remark made on the loss which
         we should feel if she were removed
         from us, she disclaimed all idea of
         worthiness in herself; her short-com
         ings she said, were many, and she
         had nothing to trust to but our Sa-
         viour's merits. On the following day
         though very weak so that she had not
         spoken all the morning, she rallied
         a little when Br. Edwards called in
         the afternoon, and uttered a few
         broken sentences, the purport of
         which was, that she longed to go
         home soon to be with the Lord.

         The farewell blessing in reference to her
         departure, was now given, and her
         dear bought soul recommended to the
         hands of her Redeemer, who had led
         her so graciously throughout her
         course, and made her so rich a
         means of blessing to others. She
         was again favored with an inter-
         val of consciousness on the 6th (Sat-
         urday last) and requested her visitor
         to pray with her. From that time 
         she gradually sunk away, until on
         Monday the 8 it pleased the Lord
         to release her from her worn-out ta-

         dedicated to active service in the family

         her final resignation on account of
         increasing infirmity in Nov. 1845.
         It may be truly said of her, that it was
         her greatest happiness to do good, and
         the manner in which she performed
         her deeds of kindness, made them
         still more valuable. Humility, indeed,
         was likewise a very leading feature
         in her character, and nothing would
         have distressed her more than the
         thought of being made the subject
         of eulogy. Still, it is meet to acknow-
         ledge the grace of God and the un-

         so much, and to set before our minds

         and love, which graced her walk and
         conversation, as she went in and out

         We may still admit to her sincere
         and steady love for the Lord's house
         and ordinances. His place in Church
