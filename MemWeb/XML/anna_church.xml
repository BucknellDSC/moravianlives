            <p> Brief Memoir of the Widow

               <p>I was born <date><abbr>Feb.</abbr> 2, 1756</date> at
               <placeName>Neustadt in Silesia</placeName>, during a
               <name type="emotion">very distressing &amp; troublous period</name>.
               My Parents before my birth resisted
               in <placeName>Lauenburg</placeName>, but from there
               they were obliged to remove to
               <placeName>Neustadt</placeName>, having lost their all,
               by means of a fire, which consum-
               ed the greater part of the town.
               When I was only a few weeks old,
               my Parents were obliged to flee
               with me in the midst of winter,
               by occasion of the following cir-
               cumstance.</p>
               <p>The Roman Catholics (for some reason which I do not know) had determined to set
               fire to the town. My Father standing at his door was accosted by two Priests, who
               requested him to hold. </p>

               My Father at first had no wish
               to live in a <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>, but during my
               Mother's last illness, having to fetch
               my brother home from a distance,
               &amp; passing through <placeName>Gnadenfrey</placeName>, he
               remained there one Sunday, &amp; attend-
               ed the Chapel. During the service it
               was impressed upon his mind, that
               this was the place for him; He there-
               fore determined to oppose it no longer,
               &amp; on his return home, gave my Mother
               <name type="emotion">no little joy</name> by telling her he would
               now go to the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>. She then sent
               my brother to <placeName>Gnadenfrey</placeName> to <persName><abbr>B</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi><abbr>.</abbr></hi>
                  Cowley</persName>, who treated him as his own
               son, &amp; taught him his business.
               After my Mother's departure, my
               Father settled all his affairs, &amp; remov-
               ed to <placeName>Gnadenfrey</placeName>, taking me with
               him. I lived in the <abbr>S</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r's</abbr></hi></hi> house,
               where I spent <name type="emotion">6 happy years</name>. I still

               despised my weak endeavors, but
               has graciously accepted my feeble
               efforts to promote his cause.</p>
               <p>I <name type="emotion">felt much to leave <placeName>Gnadenberg</placeName></name>, &amp;
               all my dear friends there, but par-

               several miles on our way to <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>,
               &amp; When they left us, commended us to
               our Lord's gracious leading &amp; protection.</p>
               <p>At <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName> we were married <date><abbr>Oct.</abbr>
                  9. 1706.</date> After our marriage my hus-
               band was ordained, &amp; I was accepted
               an <sic>Acoluth</sic> <corr>Acolyte</corr> at the same meeting.
               Having received the necessary in-
               structions from the <orgName>U.E.C.</orgName> &amp; after
               taking an affectionate leave of the
               <abbr>Cong<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr>. at <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, we set out, accom-
               panied by the prayers &amp; good wishes
               of the <abbr>Cong<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr>. Our journey was a
               <name type="emotion">distressing</name> one. We arrived at <placeName>Barby</placeName>
               on the <date>20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi></date> having <sic>travelled</sic> <corr>traveled</corr> 3 days &amp;
               3 nights in an open wagon in deep
               snow, &amp; frost so intense, that our clothes
               were frozen stiff on our backs.

            <p>         
               This laid the foundation of a
               severe cold, which brought on violent
               Erysipelas. We set out however, again,
               I <sic>travelled</sic> <corr>traveled</corr> 5 days &amp; 6 nights without
               intermission, to <placeName>Wesel</placeName>. Here I felt
               a considerable degree of fever from
               the effects of the cold.</p>
               <p>Our next Stage was <placeName>Arnheim</placeName>, where
               we experienced a gracious preservation
               from our Lord. The fore axle of our
               carriage having broken, we were
               dragged several yards close to the
               sloping bank of the city moat, but
               were extricated from our perilous
               situation by the soldiers on duty.
               We rendered heartfelt thanks to our
               Lord for this merciful Preservation.
               From here I arrived at Z<placeName>eist</placeName> in a high
               fever, &amp; my right eye quite closed up.
               We rested here from <date><abbr>Oct<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">r</hi></hi></abbr> 30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> till
               <abbr>Nov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">r</hi></hi></abbr> 6<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi></date>, &amp; then through the goodness
               of our Lord were enabled to proceed
               to <placeName>London</placeName>, though I had not yet quite
               recovered, &amp; felt much inconvenience

               from my eye still being closed up.
               Here we spent 3 months enjoying the
               unremitting kindness of the <abbr>B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi></abbr> &amp; <abbr>S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></hi></abbr>
               many of whom had known my hus-
               band from a child.</p>
               <p>After much delay, &amp; having once
               been in imminent danger of being
               drowned in following the vessel to
               <placeName>Gravesend</placeName> by a boat, we at length,
               on the <date>14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> <abbr>Feb<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">y</hi></hi></abbr> 1787</date> set sail for
               <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. During most of this voyage,
               we had to experience the truth of that
               declaration, that through much
               tribulation we must follow our Lord.
               This was in some degree owing to the
               circumstances unavoidable in such
               a case. But the chief cause of our
               sufferings arose from the character
               &amp; conduct of our Captain. He had
               <hi rend="underline">made</hi> fair promises, but <hi rend="underline">kept</hi> none
               of them, nor did he permit us to enjoy
               our stipulated rights. In short, he was
               a man whose heart was an enmity
               with God, &amp; who could not therefore

               be expected to favour, or forward
               his cause, or to shew any kindness
               to those engaged in it. This we had
               painfully to experience during our
               voyage of more than 10 weeks.</p>
               <p>At length the wished-for moment
               arrived when we saw our destined
               land, but here our trials were not
               ended. We found on enquiry, that
               the ship would have to put into several
               ports, &amp; might be yet some weeks before
               it reached <placeName>Black River</placeName>, when we were
               to land. We therefore determined
               to seek some other conveyance, &amp; were
               obliged to hire a canoe to carry us
               round the Island. This part of our
               voyage which lasted 6 days, was both
               perilous, &amp; most fatiguing, but at length
               we reached the place of our destination.</p>
               <p>After our arrival, many, &amp; among
               the rest some medical gentlemen,
               expressed their assurance that we
               could not survive the fatigue &amp; ex-
               posure, to drenching rain at night,

               and scorching sun by day, which
               we had undergone. But the Lord had
               determined otherwise. He graciously
               supported my mind under all these
               trials, &amp; gave me the assurance, that
               he would preserve us, though in the
               midst of danger. "Bless the Lord,O
               my Soul, &amp; forget not all his benefits."</p>
               <p>We remained in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> about 5
               years. Here we had many heavy
               trials, &amp; much sickness, notwith-
               standing which we should have
               wished to remain longer then, -but
               my dear husband's health impera-
               tively demanding a change of climate,
               we were obliged to return to <placeName>England</placeName>.
               In looking over the time spent in
               <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, I see numberless instances
               of my Saviour's long suffering &amp; loving-
               kindness to <name type="emotion">rejoice over &amp; be thankful

               of my own to <name type="emotion">mourn over</name>; but I trust

               hope, that a few see? the heed in good
               ground.</p>
               <p>When we first returned to <placeName>England</placeName>
               we could not help feeling a <name type="emotion">little anx-

               whether any situation would be open
               for us; but here our Lord mercifully
               provided for our wants. Just before
               we arrived, <persName><abbr>B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">r</hi></hi></abbr> Verney</persName> had departed
               at <placeName>Wyke</placeName>, &amp; we were appointed to serve

               <p>Our next appointment was to
               <placeName>Gomersal</placeName>, where we resided 7 years,
               during which time all our children
               were born, (with the exception of one
               still born son in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>.)</p>
               <p>I can truly say that we considered
               these dear children as precious gifts
               from our Lord, &amp; determined from Him

               Christ. One of our children departed
               here, aged 11 weeks. This was a great
               trial to us, but we were enabled to
               resign her into the Lord's hands, &amp; to
               say with Job, "The Lord gave &amp; the
               Lord hath taken away." The time
               we lived with this dear <abbr>Cong<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr> was
               always remembered by us with grati-
               tude to our Saviour, for the love &amp;
               confidence which we were favored to
               feel from our <abbr>B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi></abbr> &amp; <abbr>S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></hi></abbr>, &amp; a large cir-
               cle of friends not in <sic>connexion</sic> <corr>connection</corr> with
               our church. From <placeName>Gomersal</placeName> we re-
               moved to <placeName>Mirfield</placeName>. During our stay
               there, the Chapel was built &amp; the
               Boys School commenced. After
               living here 2 1/2 years, we were called
               to serve the <abbr>Cong<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr> in <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>, where
               we remained 1 1/2 years. From thence

               which they showed us, during the
               illness &amp; at the departure of our Son,
               will always remain <name type="emotion">deeply impressed
                  on my heart</name>. He was indeed a dear
               Son to us, &amp; gave promise of being a
               useful member of our Church.</p>
               <p>His amiable disposition gained for
               him the love of all who knew him.
               It was a severe stroke to part with one
               so beloved, but, it was the Lord's doing,
               &amp; he had a right to claim that which
               he had only lent for a season. His age
               was 16 years.</p>
               <p>From <placeName>Bedford</placeName> we went to <placeName>Dukinfield</placeName>,
               &amp; after residing there 1 1/2 years, removed
               to <placeName>Devonport</placeName>. The 7 years we lived here
               were a season of trial, but mercy was
               still mixed in our cup; for we enjoyed
               much love &amp; kindness, both from
               members of our flock, &amp; friends not in

               <p>Her stay in <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>was but short.

               I cannot visit the <abbr>B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi></abbr> &amp; <abbr>S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></hi></abbr> in their
               houses, but our Saviour knows how
               often I have prayed for them, that he
               may give them every needful gift &amp;
               blessing, &amp; He, I am sure, will not put
               my confidence in him to shame."</p>
            
               <p>Our beloved Mother was in the habit
               of saying with respect to herself, "I am
               no longer of any use here below, what
               can I do." We reminded her that she
               could still in her retirement from
               active service, pray to the Lord on our
               behalf &amp; that of others. "Oh yes," she said,
               "I always remember you all." It was
               evident from many things that her
               prayers were not confined to us, they em-
               braced the whole human race, the
               whole Church of God on earth. But,
               being most firmly attached to the Church
               of the <abbr>B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi></abbr>, when the Lord had mani-
               fested Himself in a saving manner
               to her soul, &amp; in which she had spent
               50 years in active service, it is no
               wonder that the cause of God <hi rend="underline">there</hi> was
               most frequently the theme of her

               conversation, &amp; the subject of her
               prayers. There was one department
               of our Church, in which she felt, <abbr>till</abbr>
               the last, the strongest interest; the
               Missionary field - <hi rend="underline"><placeName>Jamaica</placeName></hi> in
               particular. She never ceased to re-
               member &amp; to <name type="emotion">love the Black popula-
                  tion there</name>. The very mention of
               the Island was sufficient to call forth
               all her energies. At such times a
               <name type="emotion">ray of holy joy &amp; delight would light
                  up her countenance</name>, &amp; it was to her
               as if living over again those days
               long passed away. Oh what songs
               in highest strain - will theransomed
               sing in heaven - With thanksgving <abbr>&amp;e.</abbr></p>
               <p>She was in general favored with
               good health, &amp; was <name type="emotion">delighted to feel
                  that she could make herself useful</name>.
               The hope was cherished, that though
               already far advanced in years, she
               might still be spared some time
               longer. She begged however, on this
               being mentioned, that no one might
               pray for her continuance in life, as

               <name type="emotion">she desired to depart</name>. The fulfil-
               ment of this desire was nearer than
               any of us supposed. The last winter
               tried her much, especially during the
               intense frost. Her cough &amp; general
               weakness increased towards the <date>mid-
                  dle of <abbr>Feb<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">y</hi></hi></abbr>, still there was nothing cal-
               culated to alarm her relatives, - but
               from this time she gradually grew
               worse, &amp; was sometimes confined to
               her room. On <date>Sunday the 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> of March</date>,
               she found herself unable to rise from
               bed. She had thought much of the
               subject of the Holy <abbr>Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr>; &amp; the day
               before said, "How sweet it would be
               to go &amp; keep the Communion tomorrow
               with our Saviour"! At her own request
               the <abbr>Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">n</hi></hi></abbr> was administered to her
               by <persName><abbr>B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</abbr> Seifferth</persName>, who solemnly com-
               mended her in prayer to the Lord
               with reference to her departure, now
               apparently approaching. On <date>Tuesday
                  the 9</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi></date> she seemed considerably better
               &amp; on <date>Wednesday</date> sat up for some time,
               but on <date>Thursday</date> she felt much worse;

               or as the subject of particular reflections.
               She <name type="emotion">loved to hear verses</name> repeated from
               our Hymnbook, &amp; <name type="emotion">seemed to derive
                  especial comfort</name> from a hymn re-
               peated to her just after she had been
               crying out - "Dear Lord, how long"; -
               &amp; such expressions. It was this:
               "Lord my times are in thy hand" <abbr>&amp;e</abbr>
               On the day previous to her departure,
               there was an evident change in her
               manner. She had always been affec-
               tionate &amp; kind, towards her children,
               but now seemed <name type="emotion">doubly so, holding
                  out her hand &amp; looking to kindly
                  at them</name> as they came into her room.</p>
               <p>On the <date>12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi></date> she felt feverish &amp; listless,
               her hands &amp; feet were much swollen
               &amp; her face flushed, but her mind
               perfectly clear &amp; collected.
               Perceiving how much she suffered
               from difficulty of breathing, her Son
               reminded her of the Apostle's words,
               "Our light affliction" <abbr>&amp;e</abbr> - &amp; Said he hoped
               her mind was fixed on the unsure
               things of another world.

               "Yes," she replied, "when my weakness
               suffers me to think; but I am well
               assured of His faithfulness." About
               half an hour after this, she requested
               to be helped up, &amp; placed in her chair,
               that she might feel the rays of the sun,
               then shining brightly in at her window.
               She sat about a quarter of an hour,
               saying the sun was warm &amp; pleasant.
               She then returned to bed, but as she
               was settling herself in bed, her daugh-
               ter observed that her head sunk down
               a little, &amp; on looking more closely at
               her, perceived that her eyes were
               fixed in death. She still continued
               to breathe for a minute, &amp; then de-
               parted in the gentlest manner,
               the only difference in her appearance
               being, that no motion was perceptible.
               Her redeemed soul had gone to the
               arms of her Saviour.
               <gap></gap>Much might be said as to the
               character of our beloved relative, as
               a wife, a mother, a friend, a Christian, -

               and we should feel it difficult to
               convey to others the sense which we
               entertain of her worth in all these
               characters. But on this subject
               we cannot even enter, <name type="emotion">being prohibited
                  by her own express &amp; reiterated desire</name>.
               We can only say that we <name type="emotion">cherish her
                  memory with the deepest affection
                  &amp; veneration</name>; that we bless the Lord
               for the grace bestowed upon her, &amp;
               exemplified in her public &amp; private
               capacity; &amp; that while thankful
               for the example she has set us, we
               have often prayed that a double
               portion of her spirit might rest upon
               us. Her record was on high, &amp; we
               humbly yet confidently [?] she
               was received then with the com-
               mendation - "Well done, good &amp;

               to this, shortly before her departure
