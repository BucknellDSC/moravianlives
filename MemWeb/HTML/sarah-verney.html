      <p> The Life of our late Sister Sarah
         Verney who departed this life January 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> who has
         left the following account of herself.
      </p>
      <p>I was bornOctober 3<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> 1758 at Waltham
         Cross in the parish of CheshuntHertfordshire in my 9<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>Yr. I lost my dear Mother as a child I was very wild, and thought little
         about my Souls Salvation consequently I had no inclination to attend divine Service,
         to which my Father did not force me, but in other respects was very strict
         with me preventing me from dressing and mixing with such company as I
         gladly would have done; of course I as also my 2 Brs and
         Sr were obligd to keep strictly at home. In my 12<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year I went to London on a visit to see an acquaintance of my Fathers, who
         indeed appear'd very gay, and just as I could like to be She moreover took me to see many things in
         London and in short gratifyd me in every thing
         She was able, all which pleasd me highly and made me wish to leave my
         Fathers house, merely that I might have more liber -ty the above mentioned person
         also asurd me that one might very well enjoy the pleasures of this
         world, and yet be sincere in heart, in my 14<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year my
         Father went to London on a visit, and took me along with him
         to B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>
         Gibb's who wishd that I might stay a while with them
         of which I was very glad, hoping it would prove the means of my getting entirely away from home, the next
         Sunday SrGibbs took me to the B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rns</sup> Chapel which I dislikd very much, as that was
         not the way I wishd to steer my course, She next took me to see the

      <p>who treated me with much love, so that I in time got a love for the
         People of the Brntho I had nothing in my heart, and as I frequented some of the meetings,
         and also kept up a connection with the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> I got more and more love for them, and at last found myself
         very happy among them, so that I thought I had now obtaind every thing,
         and simply related my happiness to any one to whom I had an opportunity of doing it,
         but once during a Sermon of the late B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>
         LasTrobes concerning the Sin of unbelief, I was all at once
         convinc'd that I by nature was full of Sin and misery, this being
         quite the contra- -ry to what I had so lately felt and thought of myself it made me
         quite ashamed to speak to any of those with whom I had formerly conversd
         thinking they woud look upon me as nothing but a hypocrite, this brought on a
         reservedness, which lasted many Years, so that I spent my time in continual
         heaviness, keeping every thing to myself, I discoverd more and more how
         deeply I was Spoild by Sin, of which I felt powerful stirring with me, I had also many Struggles with regard to the
         Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> and the world,
         wishing at times to give myself up entire_ ly to our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>, and at other times to follow my natural
         inclination in the world, but all this I kept to myself thinking if I
         disclosd the bad things I felt, I shoud be deprivd of
         all connection with the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> and if I told the good desires of my heart, I shoud be

         I thought there coud be no truth in our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> being a Corpse, and began to think we were

      <p>to be frighten'd at myself, thinking how
         wou'd it be with me in this unbelieving way, shou'd my
         Soul be calld out of this world, this occasion'd me to Sigh
         to our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> O that I
         cou'd but believe, no sooner had this sigh burst from my heart, but
         it was as if our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>appear'd before me in his Corpse's figure, and asur'd me
         that it was on my account of my Sins that He had suffered and dy'd and that he had thereby
         procur'd peace and forgiveness for me, this was accompanied with such a di -vine feeling of
         peace that I shall never forget it. I had also several other particular visits of
         grace, all w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ch</sup> I kept quite to myself, notwithstanding the great love and
         kindness I experienc'd from my Labouress, I cou'd not be
         prevail'd upon to open my heart, and at such opportunitiescou'd only give vent to tears, which made her think I must have
         something very particular upon my mind. In my 20<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year I
         went to learn the Tambour work in the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> House, and as I look'd upon them
         to be good S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> it was of us to
         me, as they were one day in boundlike conversation among themselves to find that they
         also felt such things as I did which help'd to remove the load under
         which I had labour'd so many years, after this I had a desire to move
         en- -tirely into the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> House at
         London, which I
         however cou'd not get leave for, but it was made out for me to go to Fulneck into the Choirhouse there, this was a great trial for me, hearing so much of the
         poverty there besides leaving all my friends and acquaintances, but our
         Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> enabled me to resolve
         to live for him, and in the place he had appointed, show'd I even have
         to live upon bread and water, I accordingly arriv'd in

         Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> I never wanted for any
         thing; the first year of my abode here, I met with some difficulties, but the
         nearness of our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> comforted
         me, He not only made it clear to me that I was in my right place, but he made me
         sensible that every trial I met with was with a view to establish me in
         his grace, thus I took all wish resignation as out of his hands. Oct.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> that same

         Wyke to live with the G.
         G.r there, the beginning of my living there
         was attended with some difficulties, but in time they were remov'd, and
         we liv'd happily together in the nearness of our dear
         Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> till at a certain
         period I gave way to reasoning concerning the Labourers, and our Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> leading in the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> into which I enter'd so far

         to her, she treated me with much love, which was a comfort to me, but still I found
         no real help, my distress still encreas'd, and I began to think, was it
         possible that I cou'd ever come into a happy simple track again, or was
         I gone too far, which indeed seem'd to be my case, so that I was
         thankful when I felt a wish, and cou'd sigh to our

         but he found best to hide his face from me for near a year, thus I spent that time
         in
         heaviness often praying in the distress of my Soul for another look of his grace,
         thinking at every meeting I went to, perhaps this wou'd be the
         favor'd time, but he de- -lay'd it till by means of the

         than any of those over whom I had reason'd He also gave me
         grace to be truly a sinner before him and he in mercy forgave me anew, but I cannot
         express in words how asham'd I was, and trulyabas'd before him on account of my unfaithfulness in that respect, but
