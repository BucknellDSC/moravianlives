      <p>2. The Widow Christine Eleonore Seidel.
         (her Maiden Name was Peistel)
         She wrote of herself:
         I am born the 28<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May 1707 at Litowiz in
         Misonie. Myn Vater has been Carl Fridric Peisteland my Mother Eleonore born of Bradenstein,
         of the generation Zoeshen by Merseburg. We have
         been 5 Brethren &amp; SistersChildren, two of them 
         are gone home in their tender Ages, and we three
         have been brought up at home, and we came according
         to our Pradestination to the Congregation.
         We had a Lovefull but a serious Mother,
         who had our true best at Heart, She was a 
         Lover of the Cross of Christ &amp; acknowledgedChrist crucified for her only Happiness in time
         &amp; Eternity for every Body. She had a Connectionw.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> our Saviour &amp; did not Love the World, &amp;
         This has been the Subsect of her discoursing w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> us, in a very
         evangelical Manner &amp; this effected towards our Mother by us
         a great Love &amp; respect. By occasion She very often
         declard to us: that our Saviour certified her Heart,
         that not one of her Children should be lost, but all
         should become his Property &amp; live for him in this World.
         This made some times a deep Impression on our Hearts,
         I for my Part was not without Feeling, nevertheless I
         did not know my Redeemer. In the Time following
         the Lust to the World begun to stir &amp; I began to like
         the World &amp; the World liked me &amp; seekd for me.

      <p>Alone my true Saviour did't leave me Rest in
         Pleasure whatsoever but transformed all wordly Pleasuresinto Bitterness, Grief &amp; Mourning. I knew very well
         I was not converted &amp; therefore took one Resolution
         after the other, but without Effect; then I always begun
         driven by the Restlessness of my Heart w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my own

         us, and we got a Proceptor from D<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Buddei, Named

         us; and was of one Opinion w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> our Dear Mammy.

      <p>A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>1735 our dear Saviour took our dear Mother
         on a sudden but very happy home to himself.
         We, her three Children where present, because our
         Brother to the same time a Prussian Officer came
         home by a instinct unknown for what, he found
         her still well, but had not long to wait to see her
         closing her Eyes happy &amp; in Peace. Her so happy
         &amp; JoyfulFarewell, had such a Effect on our Hearts
         that we three together took the resolution at once,
         to have no part w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> the World, but to give our
         whole Hearts to our Saviour Jesus Christ.
         But I for my part did't know this true Friend
         of Sinners. I tried all the means I could, I read very
         
      </p>
      <p>often the History of the Suffering &amp; Death of our Saviour
         not without Effect upon my Heart; but I alwaysbeganby becoming Pious &amp; to Show my Duty to God, and
         so I came by all my restlessness not farther.
         Then I became acquainted with Separatists, &amp; would
         undoubtedly have fallen deeper &amp; deeper in my own Working;
         had not our Saviour directed, that Magister Seidel was calld as
         Deacon to Mutschen as the Place of our Residence.

         respect. This Marriage was a great Blessing to my
         Heart. My Husbands' tender Conversation w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> our 
         Saviour moved my Heart anew, that as he ask'd me
         in the first Days of our Marriage: how it would be
         with me? if People would drive him out for the Sakeof our dear Saviour out of the Town &amp; Country?
         I made a Covenant w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> him, to follow him willingly [.]

         in Hhuth. This Visit brought a great Blessing about
         his Heart and I got my Share by that dreams to.

      <p>who came to see him, from the Power of the Blood
         of Christ with a becoming Tenderness.
         His happy &amp; Joyful Departure to our Saviour renewd
         &amp; fastened the Impression, I had, of the blessed Con_
         versation w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> him.
         
      </p>
      <p>Now my former Inclination to the had fixd in me such a
         Fear of myself, that I no where trusted to live, &amp;
         imagined Danger every where; but the Friend of
         my Soul soon recollected to me, that I lookd more
         on my blessed Husband as on the Connection w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> him.
         This made me prostrate myself before &amp; I begged
         w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1000 Fears forgiveness over all what passed.
         He Mercy took me as I was, &amp; I had from
         thence a more happy Period. By all that, I could
         not get rid of my Scrupulosity by the feelings of
         my Misery &amp; like a Child draw near to him
         according to my Wish, therefore the Fear of myself
         darkneth my happy Hours very often. In this
         very Year, I &amp; my Sister went to see the Con_
         gregation at Hhuth, there I felt the very
         Peace of God, and the Brethren &amp; Sisters I
         looked on as Children of God and had a great
         respect towards them &amp; I wishd incognito to
         live in this Place. 1742. We came to see Hhuth a
         second time &amp; there we determined to remove thither.
         But by setting out for Herrnhuth some Accident
         happened &amp; we postponed our Journey. Hereby
         
      </p>
      <p>a dangerous Period for my poor Heart begun,
         a false Poeple filled our Minds with so much
         dangerous Expectations and Things against the
         Congregation, that our Journey was quite dropped.
         By all that our Saviour was so gracious to
         beware that I did't sin against his Church, &amp;
         my Desire still remaining to spend my Days under
         this Poeple. I was busy in reading the DisciplesSermons deliverd at Berlin &amp; begged our Saviour
         very often that if I belonged to this Folks, 
         he would himself find means to bring me thither.
         As my Brother moved from Wetteravia to Bertholsdorf,
         I &amp; my Sister paid him a Visit there for some
         Weeks, by that we saw what false Opinions
         had for foundation. But for all that I knewvery well that some People who came to the Con_
         gregation have been sent by &amp; by back again, this
         made me terribly afraid to venture asking Leave
         nevertheless I felt a Instinct in my Heart
         that I belonged to this People. At last I &amp; my
         Sister desireth Leave to stay in Bertholsdorf(only to be near Hhuth &amp; to try if we belong
         to the Congregation or not) We got Leave
         &amp; then the 9<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Jan. 1747. we arrived in
         Bertholsdorf to stay there.
         
      </p>
      <p>Exact a Month passed as the 9<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Febr. in a

         verse: Wie bin ich doch so herzlich froh. My bloody
         Redeemer on a sudden appeard before me, &amp; my
         poor Heart melted away by feeling his blessed
         Nearness for Shame about my deep Misery &amp;
         Sinful Condition. I never can forget this
         blessed Moment &amp; I shall remember it &amp; adore
         my Saviour therefore in Eternity.
         
      </p>
      <p>From this Time the Sisters took more particular
         Care upon me, &amp; for all I liveth in Berthols_
         dorf I got Leave to partake on the Communion_

         &amp; Shame of my poor Heart, I was received in
         the Congregation in Hhuth, this gave one a new
         Spirit to lay down my whole Heart before my
         Redeemer as a poor Reward for his Trouble;
         and still I remember by every Reception, the 
         Grace beflowed upon my Soul by this Opportunity.

      </p>
      <p>poor Heart felt thereby.
         
      </p>
      <p>From that Time I passd my Time as well in the
         Congregation as my dear Choir cheerful and
         happy and my Heart was really attached to our dear
         Saviour. If some times a cloudy Hour came
         upon me, as whereto my poor Temper much
         inclined, it was soon dispersed as soon as my
         Heart wept for our dear Saviours feet.

         which was a Opportunity to keep close to the Heart

         her, and She was the last Choir Disciple.)
