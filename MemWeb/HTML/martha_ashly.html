         The single Sister Martha Ashly.
         She wrote of herself as follows:
         I am born the 21<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup>. Sept. 1736. at Stornhill near Wike.
         &amp; brought up in the engl. Church. In my Childhood I
         heard the Brethren ; testifying the tender Love of our
         Saviour that I got a deep Impression therefrom in my
         Heart; but this, by ; my unsettled state of Mind, soon
         faded away. Till the Time when B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. &amp; Sist<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. Held a School
         for Girls ; erected, there our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. came so powerfully on
         my Heart, that I could from the Bottom of my Heart weep
         to him, to make me a happy Child. I never shall forget
         the blessed Time among us Children, ; especially what feelings

         we had in our Meetings. A. 49 I came among the Girls, &amp;
         there I had a particular School, till I turned within all
         my spoiled Constitution towards my Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. &amp; so gave
         me anew to him as a poor reward for his Sufferings.
         In this Situation I remained as long as I was among the
         Girls &amp; the feelings of our dear Saviours Love conducted me
         through all the following Occurrences. The 13 of August
         1751. Was I received into the Congregation &amp; after a long wishing
         &amp; longing I was A. 55. the 27<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. of Jan. admitted to the holy
         Sacrament. What I ; felt thereby is inexpressible for me.
         the 4<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th.</sup> of May a.e. I came among the single Sisters,
         by this Opportunity I ; deliverd myself so as I was, to the
         Property of my Lord &amp; wished now to live in the Choir-
         House, My sickly Constitution was an Obstacle in my Wish
         however my DesireA<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>. 60. I obtained my Desire.
         Here now the holy Ghost begun to show to me my marred
         &amp; in the Bottom spoiled Nature, this made in the
         Beginning many perplexed Hours to me &amp; spoiled many
         a Happiness which I was to enjoy into our Choir-House;
         However about that to he comforted me in a very rich
         Measure, I acknowledged myself as a poor ; Sinner, so
         as I was &amp; begun quite at a new with my Bridegroom.
         Now I perceive that our Saviour begins to hasten to
         finish my poor Soul &amp; that is the Point of all my
         hearty Wishes". So far She herself.
         Our dear Sister was sickly a long Time, but behaved herself
         very patient &amp; complained about nothing, as when her Heart
         not according to her Wish was in Conversation w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>.

         At last She begun to grow weary, then since the Time her
         Sickness begun, she saw 8 of her Choir-fellows going home
         &amp; said to her Choir-Labourer: "Will my dear Saviour
         not soon come &amp; take me along to him? I can't tell
         ye how ; graciously he assisted me, as well in my ; bodily
         &amp; Souls Occurrences; I'll leave it over to him, when
         he the Moment thinks proper to take my poor Soul home.
         And in this happy Situation She expected from the pale
         Lips her last kiss; whom She received to Day in the
         27<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. Year of her Age.
