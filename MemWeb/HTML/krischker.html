      <h3>VIII The Matrone Susan Krishker</h3>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>
         <br></br>The following is a Account of herself: 
         <br></br>I am born 1712 the
         29<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Sept. at
         Hirsground in 
         <br></br>Upper Silesie.
         I was but one Year old when my Vater 
         <br></br>departed Life. In my 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year of Age I was inticed drawn
         <br></br>at once in my Heart to go in a Corner &amp; there to fall 
         <br></br>down &amp;
         pray to dear God, which I accordingly did. 
         <br></br>As soon my Mother &amp; Sisters
         perceived my doing 
         <br></br>so (because I did it often) they was very hard to me
         
         <br></br>because they was afeareth that I should become to 
         <br></br>melancholy &amp; may
         be quite Braincracked. 
         <br></br>Therefore I seek for such People, which could tell me 
         <br></br>what I wanted &amp; did't know
         myself. This was soon 
         <br></br>
         <h5>bestowed</h5>
         <br></br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
         <br></br>bestowed on me, then I came to Langendorf &amp; found
         
         <br></br>some People which meet together, reading Books and talking 
         <br></br>together
         about spiritual Matters. This I liked very well 
         <br></br>but for all that it would't do me Satisfaction.
         
         <br></br>A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>1740 I came to Hillersdorf &amp; heard there
         the first Time 
         <br></br>of our dear Saviour, this touched my Heart, &amp; from that time 
         <br></br>I
         found no more Rest till I resolved to move to the 
         <br></br>Congregation; but a soon my
         Mother get a Hint of this my 
         <br></br>Resolution, she was very angry
         &amp; sent me to her Sister, 
         <br></br>which was very watchfull upon me. However our
         
         <br></br>Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> heard my continual Prayer &amp; directed
         it also: 
         <br></br>As B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> &amp; Sister
         Beutel pasd this Way, they promised
         <br></br> upon my Desire, to take me along &amp; I soon was 
         <br></br>ready and travelled
         w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> them &amp; our Saviour guided 
         <br></br>us save to
         Gnadenfry. O how thankful was my 
         <br></br>Heart that I at last found what I so long
         desireth. 
         <br></br>Here I learned my Heart deeper to know, but by that, 
         <br></br>I found the Heart
         of my Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>alwaysgracious &amp; 
         <br></br>full of Mercy, &amp; that made me pour out many a
         
         <br></br>Tears in his Heart. A. 44 the 24<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May I was 
         <br></br>a Pertaker of the holy
         Sacrament &amp; the following 
         <br></br>November I have been receivd w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> great Number 
         <br></br>into the Congregation, As there
         was no Reception 
         <br></br>a long While, a good many Breth.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> &amp; Sisters which 
         <br></br>was gone since to our Lords Supper was among
         
         <br></br>them. A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>
         46 in the Month of July I became 
         <br></br>very sick, therefore they took
         me into the Choir House 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
         <br></br>for better to attent one. A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>57 I became Choir Disciple 
         <br></br>which brought many a new Blessings
         about my Heart, 
         <br></br>and from a much more intime Conversation arose 
         <br></br>w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my truest Friend I could in a very familiar 
         <br></br>Way
         converse w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my Saviour as one Friend w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> the Other. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <br></br>So far She herself. 
         <br></br>This Testimony we can give her: that She was a true
         
         <br></br>and faithful Heart. The 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Febr. She was taken 
         <br></br>sick, as She
         came into the Sick Room She declared herself 
         <br></br>also: God be blessed! now I'll
         lay down my Doings 
         <br></br>&amp; never think to grow well again, I'll employ my
         
         <br></br>Sabbath Days to the Interest of my Soul; &amp; I can 
         <br></br>be easy I have no
         Dissatisfaction, nothing against 
         <br></br>nobody. She was a pleasant
         &amp; happy sick 
         <br></br>Person, her Heart delighted in his Passion &amp;

         <br></br>intim &amp;
         submisse a Manner, that the other Sick 
         <br></br>Sisters melted in Tears. As her
         Labourer came 
         <br></br>to see &amp; speak w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> her, She
         said: Our Saviour 
         <br></br>was so very gracious to me in my Health &amp; 
         <br></br>now I am sick he made it so
         easy to me, 
         <br></br>that I scarcely feel the Pain of which other sick
         
         <br></br>Persons so much complain of. O there are 
         <br></br>many Things for which I have my

         <h5>enough</h5>
         <br></br>
         <p></p>
         <br></br>enough for all what he has done on my poor 
         <br></br>Soul. She repeated very
         often: O my dearest 
         <br></br>Lord, nothing but thine Blood &amp; Suffering &amp; Wounds 
         <br></br>is it, which has taken &amp; captivated
         my Heart: 
         <br></br>and so it shall remain for ever. 
         <br></br>This Morning the
         23<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> She declard: how
         happy am I!
