      <p>VIII The Matrone Susan KrishkerThe following is a Account of herself: I am born 1712 the
         29<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Sept. at
         Hirsground in Upper Silesie.
         I was but one Year old when my Vater departed Life. In my 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year of Age I was inticed drawnat once in my Heart to go in a Corner &amp; there to fall down &amp;
         pray to dear God, which I accordingly did. As soon my Mother &amp; Sisters
         perceived my doing so (because I did it often) they was very hard to me
         because they was afeareth that I should become to melancholy &amp; may
         be quite Braincracked. Therefore I seek for such People, which could tell me what I wanted &amp; did't know
         myself. This was soon bestowed
         <br></br>
      </p>
      <p></p>Susanna Krischker, page 2
      <p>bestowed on me, then I came to Langendorf &amp; found
         some People which meet together, reading Books and talking together
         about spiritual Matters. This I liked very well but for all that it would't do me Satisfaction.
         A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>1740 I came to Hillersdorf &amp; heard there
         the first Time of our dear Saviour, this touched my Heart, &amp; from that time I
         found no more Rest till I resolved to move to the Congregation; but a soon my
         Mother get a Hint of this my Resolution, she was very angry
         &amp; sent me to her Sister, which was very watchfull upon me. However our
         Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> heard my continual Prayer &amp; directed
         it also: As B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> &amp; Sister
         Beutel pasd this Way, they promised upon my Desire, to take me along &amp; I soon was ready and travelled
         w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> them &amp; our Saviour guided us save to
         Gnadenfry. O how thankful was my Heart that I at last found what I so long
         desireth. Here I learned my Heart deeper to know, but by that, I found the Heart
         of my Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>alwaysgracious &amp; full of Mercy, &amp; that made me pour out many a
         Tears in his Heart. A. 44 the 24<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May I was a Pertaker of the holy
         Sacrament &amp; the following November I have been receivd w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> great Number into the Congregation, As there
         was no Reception a long While, a good many Breth.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> &amp; Sisters which was gone since to our Lords Supper was among
         them. A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>
         46 in the Month of July I became very sick, therefore they took
         me into the Choir House

      <p></p>Susanna Krischker, page 3
      <p>for better to attent one. A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o</sup>57 I became Choir Disciple which brought many a new Blessings
         about my Heart, and from a much more intime Conversation arose w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my truest Friend I could in a very familiar Way
         converse w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my Saviour as one Friend w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> the Other. 
      </p>
      <p>So far She herself. This Testimony we can give her: that She was a true
         and faithful Heart. The 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Febr. She was taken sick, as She
         came into the Sick Room She declared herself also: God be blessed! now I'll
         lay down my Doings &amp; never think to grow well again, I'll employ my
         Sabbath Days to the Interest of my Soul; &amp; I can be easy I have no
         Dissatisfaction, nothing against nobody. She was a pleasant
         &amp; happy sick Person, her Heart delighted in his Passion &amp;
         sometimes talkd conversd w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> our
         Saviour in the so tender intim &amp;
         submisse a Manner, that the other Sick Sisters melted in Tears. As her
         Labourer came to see &amp; speak w.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> her, She
         said: Our Saviour was so very gracious to me in my Health &amp; now I am sick he made it so
         easy to me, that I scarcely feel the Pain of which other sick
         Persons so much complain of. O there are many Things for which I have my
         deasrest Sav.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>1000 times to praise, &amp; 1000 Thanks are not enough
         <br></br>enough for all what he has done on my poor Soul. She repeated very
         often: O my dearest Lord, nothing but thine Blood &amp; Suffering &amp; Wounds is it, which has taken &amp; captivated
         my Heart: and so it shall remain for ever. This Morning the
         23<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> She declard: how
         happy am I! Myn Sabbaths Day is at Hand, the greatest Day I ever knew.
         At Noon, her expected &amp; happy Hour struck at which the Blessing of her
         Choir was bestowed on her, &amp; so her Mouth grow pale in her Soul went
         home to her Friend in the 51<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> Year of her Age.
