         A Copy of the course of Life of the
         Single Sister Sarah Christiana Nichols, who
         Departed this Life at Tytherton in Wiltshire;
         as left in her own hand-writing.
         It has frequently been a subject of doubt with
         me whether I should leave my written account
         of my course thro' time. The benefit I have of=
         =ten received from the testimonies of deceased
         Brethren and Sisters has made me feel a wish
         also to declare what the Lord hath done for my
         Soul. (Impressed with this desire, most graci=
         =ous God and Savior, I entreat the aid of thy
         Holy Spirit to teach and guide my heart and hand,
         so that every sentence may be penned with the
         only view to humble the sinner, and exalt the
         Savior, and to set forth the power of divine
         grace and mercy.)
         I was Born December 12th. 1768. at
         Brinkworth in Wiltshire, my Parents were
         members of the Brethrens Church, and the
         meetings were held weekly at their house; so
         that from early infancy I had the priviledge
         of being instructed in the ways of Salvation.
         My Dear Parents, whose chief concern it was
         that their children might learn to know and

         love God our Savior, sought every opportunity
         of directing my attention to Him, as the Friend
         of Children, often telling me how much he had
         done and suffered to make me eternally happy-
         Well do I remember some affecting conversation
         of my dear Mother upon this interesting subject,
         and the salutary impression thereby made upon
         my mind. But it pleased our Savior to re=
         =move this tender parent out of time when I
         was only in my 8th year, too young to be aware
         of the loss I had sustained. My dear Father,
         to whom I was exceedingly attached, was of
         course deeply affected by this bereavement,
         being left a Widower with 4 Children of
         whom I was the eldest; but his redoubled
         kindness and affection soon obliterated all
         trouble from my volatile spirits. At this time
         I went with other children to the village
         school, where I heard many hurtful things
         to which I was totally unaccustomed, and
         which made me often very uneasy. I was
         also ridiculed by my companions on account
         of the religion of my Parents, which they
         loaded with the greatest absurdities, and the
         most unjust accusations. These insinuations,
         which I knew to be false affected my mind
         in various way, and often depressed my
         spirits. I earnestly entreated my Father to

         Father to remove me from this irksome
         situation as soon as possible, which no
         doubt was his wish, as well as mine;
         and to my inexpressible joy, I obtained leave
         to live in the Sisters Choir House in Tytherton,
         and went thither July 19th. 1776. being then
         only in the 10th Year of my age. A new pe=
         =riod now commenced with me, I esteemed
         it a favor to be in a habitation which I
         looked upon as dedicated to the Lord, and
         to have the privilege of attending so many meet=
         =ings. Our Savior was pleased to manifest
         Himself to my heart in a distinguished man=
         =ner: I could in simplicity spread all my
         wants before Him, and received many assu=
         =rances of His love and mercy. I delighted
         to converse with my companions upon
         these subjects, and to describe what passed
         in my soul. I often longed and prayed for
         some divine intimation that my individu=
         =al petitions were heard by our Savior, and
         He condescended to satisfy me in this respect,
         in so various and striking a manner, as
         never to be forgotten: it excites at this mo=
         =ment sensations of gratitude wonder and
         praise. After I had began -O had I but

         so proceeded. But alas! the depravity of
         my nature soon began to marr my peace:
         I found the childlike confidence in the Lord,
         which I had hitherto enjoyed gradually dimin=
         =ish, and cold indifference take place; or at other
         times my mind was harassed by unbelieving
         doubts and fears. I durst not disclose my
         situation of mind, being impressed with the
         idea, that there was not such another being
         in the whole creation of God! and that if
         the wickedness of my heart was discovered
         by those around me, I should no longer be
         suffer'd to remain with the people of the Lord.
         O how many anxious hours might I have
         been spared could I have opened my mind to
         some experienced friend, who would have giv=
         =en me proper advice, and directed me to the
         fountain which is opened for sin, and unclean=
         =ness. This uneasiness of mind took place be=
         =fore I was 12 years of age, and continued
         a long time. About a year after this I
         grew sickly, and had much bodily pain and
         weakness to struggle with, which with anx=
         =iety of mind, was at times almost insupport=
         =able; but the latter I endeavoured to conceal
         as much as possible. I often tried to make
         my self better, and resolved to begin anew;

         anew; knowing all was wrong with me,
         and that there must be a change, but how
         to effect it I knew not, I found that all
         my resolutions came to nothing, and I only
         grew worse and worse. At length I con=
         =cluded that if the Lord pleased, he could
         change my heart, but that I could do noth=
         =ing; it was therefore best to make my self
         as easy as possible, which I endeavour'd to do.
         But thanks be to my Savior, he did not
         leave Himself without a witness in my soul,
         tho' I alas, too often rejected his calls and
         disobeyed his voice. Thus I went on, till a=
         =bout the middle of my 16th. year. My
         Choir Laboress one day called me aside, and
         in a very affectionate manner express'd her
         concern on my account, saying she feared I
         was going on unconcerned about the salva=
         =tion of my soul, and trifling with my call
         of grace. I was exceedingly struck: acknow=
         =ledged her remarks were too just, but said,
         there was times, when I was very unea=
         =sy. This led to much serious conversati=
         =on on her part, and in the sequel she told
         me, that two of my companions would
         have the favor to be received into the Con=
         =gregation on the following day, of which she
         thought proper to apprize me. I thanked

         her for her kindness towards me, and
         withdrew. But never shall I forget what
         passed in my soul after this interview. I
         was roused as it were from sleep: and be=
         =gan to ask myself, what had I been doing?
         My conscience spoke aloud and accused me
         of the basest ingratitude, and most unpardon=
         =able neglect. The Holy Spirit, whose sacred
         work it is to convince men of sin, set mine
         before me in dreadful array, so that the
         burthen of them seemed too great to be borne.
         I passed the night in very great anxiety,
         and the morning brought me no relief. I
         sought to be alone, where I might give
         vent to my grief without observation.
         It being Sunday I however went to the fore=
         =noon Preaching hoping to obtain some com=
         =fort, but alas! my heart was not suffici=
         =ently broken yet. The Congregation meet=
         =ings which followed, I had leave to attend,
         but I thought, no; they do not belong to
         me; I have no right to sit in such an
         assembly. But it was as if an inward
         monitor compelled me, and resistance
         was in vain. I therefore seated myself in
         the Chapel, feeling as an out-cast, who
         had neither part nor lot in the matter.
         I endeavored to recollect that the Lord

         7.
         was gracious, and that I had felt his love
         when a child, but this seemed only to in=
         =crease my condemnation. However the hap=
         =py moment of my deliverance now drew near:
         during the meeting for reception, the grace of
         God was so powerfully operative in my soul,
         that my proud spirit was humbled: my heart
         seemed to melt within me: I thought, who
         knows, but there may be mercy even for me!
         And the gracious answer was given. - Yea, for
         thee! I have brought thee with my blood: thou
         art mine, saith the Lord! and thou also be=
         =longest, in an especial manner to this fold.
         O what sensations of gratitude and wonder
         then pervaded me: it was truly like one who
         had received life from the dead. My doubts
         and fears vanished and the load which had
         so sorely oppressed me was removed, I now
         thought, if I had a thousand hearts they
         should be devoted to Him, who had merited
         such happiness for the vilest of sinners.
         Ah! "Little then my self I knew ." - Little
         was I aware of the corruption still dwelling with=
         =in me, which would yet occasion so much
         smart. I now felt an ardent desire to be ac=
         =knowledged a member of the Brethrens Church,
         believing I might thereby be more established
         in grace, and my happiness increased. In
         a short time therefore I made application for
         this privilege, not doubting but I should soon

         obtain my wish, having previously felt such
         a powerful conviction that this people was
         indeed my people, and their God, my God.
         But my hopes were disappointed, which I
         could not at that time understand, and even
         presumed to wonder at others being prefer=
         =red before me. But wonder shortly ceased:
         The vileness of my nature appeared to me a suf=
         =ficient reason, why my request should
         not be granted, till a change should take
         place. I often thought. - Oh that I could find
         a person whose case was, or had been si=
         =milar to my own: what a relief would
         it be to unbosom my self to such an one;
         and to hear how they found help. Then the idea,
         but, "there are no such," was continually re=
         =curring to my mind: "it is in vain to think
         about it." But, perhaps the Lord requires
         it of me, and such a disclosure is necessa=
         =ry to promote the future welfare of my soul.
         This was a just conclusion, could I have
         ventured to abide by it; but the time was
         not yet come. After many months had
         elapsed in this way, I at last resolved
         entirely to give up what I had so long
         and so ardently desired, being persuad=
         =ed that I could not obtain such a favor till

         9.
         till my heart was thoroughly changed,
         and the burthen of my sinful nature re=
         =moved far from me. The grace of God
         our Savior was alone able to effect this, I
         knew, and I trusted that in his good time
         he would perform it. I had not then learn=
         =ed, that complete deliverance from indwell=
         =ing corruption is not to be attained in this
         imperfect state. At this time, when I
         least expected it, my request was grant=
         =ed, and I was received a member of the
         Brethrens CongregationJuly 25th. 1784.
         This appeared to me a favor of which
         I was very undeserving, and my sensati=
         =ons may easier be conceived than described.
         The desperate wickedness of my heart,
         however, lay as a heavy burthen on my
         mind; I believed, notwithstanding, that
         the Lord would help me by some means
         which I could not see or understand. and,
         Blessed be His Sacred name! He did not
         put my confidence to shame. In a few
         days after the above transaction, a Sister
         with whom I had previously conversed
         upon various subjects, sought an opportu=
         =nity to be with me alone, and first ex=
         =pressed much pleasure at my admission

         to that Church fellowship, to which I was
         called, thro' grace, and for which, she knew,
         I had long been a candidate. But said she,
         you must excuse me, if I tell you that I
         felt much concern likewise on your account.
         For what reason I asked; she replied, be=
         =cause your countenance indicated to me,
         that there was a load on your spirits.
         Can you say there is not? I was astonish=
         =ed beyond measure, and enquired if she
         thought I had been guilty of some outward
         transgression, which lay heavy on my
         conscience. By no means, was the reply.
         it is sins of the heart only which I have
         in view. I burst into tears and was una=
         =ble to reply. she therefore proceeded, and I
         soon found, that she was no stranger to my
         inward sorrows, Oh what joy did this oc=
         =casion! My unwilling tongue was now
         loosed, and I felt freedom, to disclose the
         hidden source of grief, to which I had so long
         been a prey. The advice and encouragement
         I received from this dear Sister, whose expe=
         =rience corresponded very nearly with my
         own, was such a relief and consolation to
         my mind, as no language can describe:
         We wept together. and surely the blessed

         Spirit of God accompanied her words to my
         heart, and opened my understanding to see
         things in a new light. How precious did the
         blood of atonement now appear to my soul.
         I saw and was thankful to see that tho' I
         should remain a sinful creature, yet the me=
         =rits, and grace of a crucified Savior mere a=
         =bundantly sufficiently to save me from the
         condemning power of the love of sin. This was
         an important hour to me! such as will never
         be forgotten in time, nor, I have often thought,
         even in eternity. The friend I have alluded
         to, has long been at home with the Lord;
         and surely, if we shall hereafter be permitted to
         know those who have been instrumental to our
         happiness, she cannot escape my notice, when
         I have the favor to arrive in that Haven of
         rest. - I hope I shall be excused for dwelling
         much on this circumstance; it was of great
         consequence to me, and I most sincerely
         wish, that if any young persons should
         hear this account, whose case is any degree
         similar, they may here be encouraged to open
         their mind freely, and without disguise, to
         some experienced friend, who knows how to
         give them good advice: it will remove a heavy
         burthen, and promote their growth in grace,

         and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi=
         =our Jesus Christ. It is true that He alone
         can effectually relieve the distressed soul, but
         it is our duty to use the appointed means.
         I need scarcely say, that from this time, a
         great change took place in my heart, and that
         for a season, I felt inexpressibly happy: my
         soul did truly magnify the Lord, and my
         Spirit rejoiced in God my Savior. I now
         saw and believed, that the blood of Jesus
         Christ, shed on Calvary; was not only a foun=
         =tain once opened for sin and uncleanness, but
         that it is a never failing stream to which poor
         sinners may daily apply: that notwithstand=
         =ing all their defilements of the flesh and of
         the spirit, they may wash here and be clean.
         What a precious truth! and how exactly suited to
         my need! My only wish now was, to be the en=
         =tire property of Him who had done so much
         for me, and to devote my self to him, with spi=
         =rit, soul, and body. - "As I am so take me,
         - With my worst and best; - Ever thine pre=
         =serve me, - Till with thee I rest." Was
         the sincere and unfeigned language of my
         heart. Who would think; - after such grace
         bestowed, we should be so prone to forsake
         the one only fountain, and to hew to ourselves
         cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no wa=

         heart! Who can know it? In October the
         same year, I was favor'd to be spectator
         at the Holy Communion, which filled me
         with gratitude and praise. The moments I
         spent beholding the Congregation partake of
         their divine repast, were some of the happi=
         =est in my whole life, I will not attempt to
         describe what I enjoyed; Suffice it to say, it
         was inexpressible delight, such as has seldom
         fallen to my lot here below; nor perhaps
         would it have been the best for me. for
         through human weakness, even this proved
         the occasion of some perplexity. When I became
         a Candidate for the Holy Communion on Good-
         =Friday 1785. I was led to expect the same
         degree of enjoyment as before, but was not
         so favor'd, at which I felt disappointed.
         To be a partaker of the Lord's body and blood
         sacramentally appeared very important to me,
         and I felt unworthy of such a privilege. My
         views, at this time, were certainly too legal,
         and I formed erroneous ideas respecting the prop=
         =er state of heart, in which we should draw
         nigh to the Table of the Lord. On the 17th.
         of April, after previous confirmation, I par=
         =took of the Lords Supper, with the Congregati=
         =on the first time. But instead of that sanc=

         =wards was enabled to turn in prayer to our
         Savior, and he granted me such a sweet sen=
         =sation of his pardoning love, that my doubts
         were removed, and by degrees I learned to
         know, that a broken and contrite heart is most
         acceptable in his sight, and that poverty of
         spirit is the best preparation for this sacred
         ordinance. Some months now elapsed, in which
         I enjoyed true peace and rest; I seemed to have
         obtained all I wished; nor would I have ex=
         =changed my lot for all this world could af=
         =ford. But a severe trial was at hand, of
         which a secret voice seemed occasionally to warn
         me; but I earnestly prayed that the stroke might
         be averted, thinking it would be heavier than I
         could bear. My Dear Fathers health had been
         declining for some years, and he grew very in=
         =firm. My attachment to him had been great.
         and deservedly so, from early infancy. The
         many prayers I have heard him offer at the throne
         of grace, for all his children, and my self in par=
         =ticular, have been ever considered among the
         numberless mercies, for which I am indebted
         to sovereign and unmerited goodness. In
         August I went with my Sister to pay him

         a visit, and the change I saw in his coun=
         =tenance made me fear that his sickness
         would end in dissolution. During the few
         days that he survived, he was mostly de=
         =lirious, but had many lucid intervals. In
         one of these he saw me standing by his bed,
         and asked me why I wept? I answered, Be=
         =cause I know not, what I shall do when
         you are removed hence. He replied, "Trust
         in the Lord! He hath been my Friend; He
         will be yours also." These words have often
         come into my mind since that day. On the
         12th. his happy soul took flight, and I was
         left to deplore his loss, which I did in such
         bitterness of soul, as will never be forgotten.
         I refused to be comforted, and could see no plea=
         =sure in any created thing, and if I heard any
         expression of joy: I wondered where it was
         to be found! The sight of my dear Brothers
         and Sister heightened my grief, and surely,
         had not an unseen hand supported me at this
         trying period, I must have been overwhelm'd.
         Several circumstances tended to aggravate my
         distress, and one in particular. It was
         Judged proper that I, being the eldest,
         should continue with my Brothers, and not
         return to Tytherton with my Sister. This
         was an unexpected stroke, and made me

         16.
         made me still more earnestly intreat our
         Savior, to take me into eternal safety: as I fore=
         =saw, that much hurt to my soul might ensue.
         Going to rest one night with an anxious and
         burthened mind, as usual, I besought the Lord
         with many tears to save and deliver me from
         what I so much dreaded; 'till at length weary
         and oppressed I fell asleep, and had the following
         remarkable dream. I thought my self possess'd
         of a Beautiful ring, but how, or by what means
         I received it, I could never recollect; it was placed
         on my right hand, and I was commanded never to
         lose it, or suffer it to be removed. This I thought
         an easy injunction, which I could without difficulty
         obey. In the midst of the ring was a large stone
         so brilliant that it dazzled my sight. I was well
         aware of its value: that with it, I should be e=
         =ternally secure, and without it, I shouldbe eter=
         =nally lost! Awful alternative! How ought I
         to have trembled at the thought, But I gazed
         on the precious gem with delight, and rejoiced in
         my safety. My vain heart soon suggested to me,
         that every beholder would be struck with admi=
         =ration when they saw its transcendant lustre.
         Immediately I was surrounded by a large com=
         =pany of people, and my vanity was gratified
         by seeing all eyes fixed on the inestimable Jew=
         =el with which I was adorned. They begged
         for a nearer view, and I reluctantly yielded

         17.
         yielded to their request. Instantaneously
         I found the ring was withdrawn: I at=
         =tempted to grasp it; but it fell to the ground,
         from whence I snatched it with eager haste,
         and found to my utter confusion, the stone
         was gone: I sought it with many tears, cry=
         =ing aloud to those about me for help, but
         none assisted me: and when I looked around
         I found my self forsaken and alone. Left in=
         =deed to all the horrors of despair. The
         door of hope was closed, and my torment
         seemed already begun. In this dreadful
         situation, I saw my dear departed Father coming
         towards me, and dreaded his frown, but when
         I ventured to lift up my eyes, his countenance
         denoted pity and compassion: and he kind=
         =ly asked me the cause of my grief. I am
         undone for ever! was the reply, reciting my
         irretrievable loss, and adding, your removal
         out of this world is the cause of all my misfor=
         =tunes. He answered, "The Lord sees your afflic=
         =tions, and has permitted me, to tell you, that
         stone was not in your power to keep: it was
         given you for a trial, but it will be preserved
         in safer hands, and will be produced in your
         behalf at the time when you most need it."
         This was like the news of Pardon, to a con=
         =demned criminal! I now took courage and
         told him all that oppressed me: How I dreaded
         having any intercourse with the world, but
         wished rather for dissolution. And concluded

         by requesting permission to go with him.
         He answered, not now, but you shall come
         hereafter. Thereupon he vanished out of my
         sight, and I awoke; my mind being impres=
         =sed with such sensations of awe and grati=
         =tude, as I cannot express in words. And
         though I lay no stress upon dreams in gene=
         =ral, yet I must, and do believe that this
         was permitted for wise purposes. My Hea=
         =venly Father knew my critical situation, and
         how dangerous it was to my youth and inex=
         =perience, to be in my measure exposed to a
         vain and treacherous world, totally unacquaint=
         =ed, as I was, with its enticing snares. And
         He who wept at the grave of Lazarus, did
         not disdain to notice my tears and sorrows
         over the loss of my best earthly Friend.
         After the above mentioned circumstance my bur=
         =then was somewhat alleviated. I felt a hum=
         =ble confidence in God my Savior, and could
         apply many precious promises contained in
         His Holy word to my self. That tho Father=
         =less children are peculiar objects of divine
         compassion, is a consolatory truth, which
         proves a balm to my wounded mind. I
         believed that I had a Father in Heaven; who was
         not unmindful of my individual concerns; and
         this afforded me real comfort. But notwithstand=
         =ing all the loving kindness and tender mercy
         shown me by the Lord, at this memorable pe=
         =riod of my life, I felt a dread of impending
         danger into which I was liable to plunge, thro'

         the deceitfulness of sin, and the depravity of
         my corrupt nature; Unless some special
         mark of divine favor and acceptance should
         be vouchsafed unto me, which I had hitherto
         not obtained. I had heard of children of God
         who had been favored with extraordinary manifes=
         =tations of our Lords presence to the eyes of their
         mind, and of their being assured of the forgive=
         =ness of their sins, in so powerful a manner,
         as to preclude, from that hour all doubt upon
         the subject. I had often prayed that such experience
         might be mine, and now it appeared so need=
         =ful to me, that I was convinced I ought not to
         rest satisfied, till I had obtained it. But the
         Lords ways are not our ways. nor His thoughts
         our thoughts! I was seeking great things for
         my self on which I might depend, and forgot
         that my strength lay only in looking daily
         unto Jesus, and that by relying upon Him a=
         =lone I could be preserved. It pleased our Sa=
         =vior to convince me of my error, in this respect,
         by means of a discourse to the congregation,
         treating of our Lords various leadings with
         his children, and how their faith was often put
         to the test, as in the case of the Woman of Canaan.
         When she besought Him to heal her daughter.
         Her humility and faith struck me, as being re=
         =corded for my imitation, and seemed to point
         out exactly that, wherein I was wanting. I
         felt conscious, that the smallest crumb of grace
         was more than I deserved, and yet much had
         been given unto me. That I had no right to

         dictate to our Savior, but night, humbly
         and thankfully, to take out of His hands,
         what he was pleased to bestow. His gracious
         words. Blessed are they that have not seen,
         and yet have believed",were applied, by the Holy
         Spirit. with such power to my heart, that I was
         enabled with conviction, to say, My Lord, and
         my God! I now believe that thy grace is suffici=
         =ent for me, and that to take out of thy fullness
         day by day, is the sinners only safety." I now,
         for a season enjoyed true rest for my soul.
         Humble, and poor in spirit, I found that peace
         which the world can neither give or take away.
         To live in close communion with the Friend of
         sinners, was my only desire. "Whom have I
         in Heaven, but thee? and there is none on earth
         that I desire beside thee?" Was the unfeigned
         language of my heart. I felt, indeed, much
         concern at being, in a great measure, separated
         from the Congregation, and more especially from
         my companions, with whom I had enjoyed so
         sweet fellowship; and often did I sigh to the
         Lord. on this account, when no human friend
         was nigh to whom I could impart my feelings.
         October 11th. 1786. I was present when the
         Sisters at Tytherton entered into their newly
         erected House, and the idea of not being an
         Inhibitant of the same caused such painful
         sensations within my breast, as I am not able
         to describe. I returned home with a heavy
         heart, begging the Lord to interpose in my
         behalf. But it pleased Him, that I should

         21.
         first learn much of human instability, and
         of the latent evil which lay in my deeply cor=
         =rupted heart. Finding that my hope of returning
         to the Sisters House, was not likely to be realiz=
         =ed, I began to reflect on what some of my friends
         had frequently suggested to me, Viz: That I was
         too much set upon it, and that I ought to make
         my mind bend to circumstances. This was well
         meant advice, I am convinced, though in my ears,
         it had often sounded harsh and unfeeling; yet now
         I began to think it had great weight, and that it
         was needful I should adopt it, which I would
         endeavour to do with all my might. But alas!
         How did I mistake the way! I thought the only
         means of doing this is to seek for society: and to
         mix with the world, in some degree; for to live
         the life of a recluse, is surely not the way to be
         happy. I had many relatives who sought my
         company, but from whom I had hitherto stood
         aloof, knowing their views did not correspond
         with mine. But now I began to associate with
         them, and others of my acquaintance with less
         scrupulosity; and might, probably, with safety,
         had I but rightly known what it is to be in
         the world, and not of the world; but this I had
         not learned; and alas! I soon began to discover,
         that the world had charms which I was before
         a stranger to, but which suited my depraved na=
         =ture too well, and soon became a snare to me.
         O had not the faithful Shepherd now kept his
         hand over me, where should I have been!

         But blessed be His name, He never left me
         alone, but followed me through all the mazes
         and windings, into which I was led by a heart
         that is deceitful above all things. The 2 Years
         that followed, I would rather pass over in si=
         =lence, though they were some of the most re=
         =markable in my whole life, and perhaps also
         not the least useful. Could I describe the ex=
         =perience I made and what my soul passed
         through during this period, it might, probably, al=
         =most stagger belief: but I will not attempt it.
         it is only known to Him, who neither slumbers,
         nor sleeps, and who watched over me with unre=
         =mitting care, never suffering me to wander far
         from the way of peace, without a pang. This I
         count a peculiar mercy. Well can I remember
         sitting in cheerful company, and feeling that a
         mark was set upon me, which made me sin=
         =gular to others, and a burthen to my self; and
         which |with shame I [?] it| I would gladly
         have shaken off, in order to be light and easy
         as the rest. What work this for repentance!
         Ah! How did my heart condemn me, when I
         reflected on the awful state of being ashamed of
         Jesus, and even of wishing to throw off the very
         appearance of being a follower of the Lamb.
         Notwithstanding all my exertions to appear like
         those I associated with, to join in the laugh, and
         partake of their innocent mirth |as it is termed|

         23.
         the warning, "Come out from among them,
         and be ye separate." often sounded in my ears,
         with a voice, like thunder, and embittered all:
         An Involuntary sigh would frequently escape,
         which, when noticed, was sure to produce rail=
         =lery, and the accusation of being sanctimoni=
         =ous and righteous over much. Ah! I thought;
         you little know, how far this is from being
         the real case: you are little aware, how I
         feel. At other times, I was commended for
         piety, for prudence, steady conduct &amp;c. &amp;c.
         by persons wishing themselves and others
         were like me, in regard to these good quali=
         =ties. This, above all the rest, stung me to the
         quick; their good opinion of me served only to
         condemn me |as a hypocrite.| On the other
         hand, my conduct was narrowly watched
         by well meaning friends, who passed cen=
         =sure upon me sometimes with more zeal
         than charity; and caused me much anxiety,
         which might have been spared, But they had
         my good in view, I have no doubt. Many
         times in the distress and perplexity of my
         mind, I have wished for some cave or her=
         =mitage far from the abodes of men, where
         I might hide from every prying eye; where
         no loathsome flattery could reach me, on
         the one hand; nor uncharitable censures on

         on the other; and where I might escape the
         snares and temptations that seemed to thicken a=
         =round me, and with which I was too weak to
         contend. I have before observed, that meetings were
         held at our house on Sundays, and the Holy Com=
         =munion administered every 4 weeks. this bless=
         =ed ordinance I trembled to approach and con=
         =tinually resolved to absent my self from it; but
         a monitor within prevented me and would not
         suffer me to keep my self away. It may be won=
         =dered at by some, that in the state of mind I
         have described, I could venture to partake of
         the Lords Holy supper, but I verily believe it
         to be one of those peculiar mercies which ought
         to be recorded by me with the warmest gra=
         =titude; for every approaching celebration led me
         to self examination, and compelled me to cry
         to Him, who was able to deliver me from
         this bondage in which I was held by the
         world and sin, and to speak pardon and peace
         to my troubled heart. This He did, blessed
         be His name! when the favor was least ex=
         =pected, so that I was constrained to own,
         with tears of Joy, "it is good for me to be
         here! Another circumstance in the chain
         of events at this peculiarly trying period of
         my life I have ever considered a particular
         blessing. The Minister, who, served in this
         small part of the Congregation was an old

         experienced Brother who appeared well acquain=
         =ted with the human heart, and knew how to
         sympathize with the weak and broken hearted
         sinner. His ministry was much blessed to my
         soul, and his conversations often encouraged me
         to cast my burthen again, and again at the feet
         of Jesus, where none can ever perish. I felt
         freedom frequently to disclose to him many of
         the ills which annoyed me, and his fatherly ad=
         =vice and counsel has strengthened my con=
         =fidence in God my Savior. He has long been
         at home with the Lord, with those, "who rest
         from their labor, and their works do follow
         them." Amidst all the vicissitudes and pur=
         =turbations of mind I passed through at this
         memorable time, my connection with the Bre=
         =threns Church remained valuable to me, and
         I never doubted, but this people was my peo=
         =ple, and their God, my God. if I might on=
         =ly be preserved from forfeiting my call of
         grace, by my own faults and unfaithfulness,
         which alas! I often feared. Once, however,
         I did form the resolution, for a few hours, only,
         to leave the Congregation though it would be
         at my peril. But after I retired to rest,
         fully intending to put the deep resolve in ex=
         =ecution, and pleased that I had so far made
         up my mind, cost what it would, not to draw
         back, I could but be unhappy. Here the hand

         of God arrested me, and made me fear,
         and tremble exceedingly in his presence.
         My heart smote me with anguish unutter=
         =able and I could only cry out in the bitter=

         me! and forgive the rebellious thought
         and intent of my heart, thy poor erring,
         and disobedient chlid." the imaginations of
         whose heart are evil, and that continually.
         This anxious petition was heard, and the thought
         of my heart was pardoned, but my pillow was
         wetted with many tears, before I received an
         answer of peace. From this time I was more
         than ever convinced that it would indeed be a
         fearful thing for me to forsake the path in
         which the Lord had called me to walk; and I
         intreated Him to preserve me therein to the end
         of my days, whether it was rough, or smooth.
         "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all
         his benefits. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all
         that is within me. Bless his holy name." I
         have often been struck with still another peculiar
         mercy of the Lord vouchsafed to me at this time,
         which I ought to record, to his praise. I had
         always been remarkably fond of reading, I may
         say immoderately so, because it was burthen=
         =some and a snare. During my abode in the
         Sisters house, I had often found it so, for ma=
         =ny times when engaged at work, I have felt
         such an insatiable thirst after knowledge, in=

         information, and food for the mind, which I
         thought was only to be acquired by reading a vari=
         =ety of books; that I have been led to murmur a=
         =gainst providence, that such a strong desire was
         implanted within me, and the means of gratifying
         it withheld! Now, many books were put into my
         hands, of which I knew nothing before, some of
         which I read with pleasure and satisfaction: they
         left no taint on the mind. But a certain de=
         =scription of books, particular those pernicious
         ones, called Novels, were not only offered to
         me, but every arguments used, that could be
         thought of, to induce me to read them. In
         time past I should not have hesitated much,
         yea, perhaps might have perused them with ea=
         =gerness; but now I felt such an inward
         check that I durst not touch them, fearing
         that if I once began, I should not know
         where to stop, but should fall deeper and deep=
         =er into error. What can I ascribe this cir=
         =cumstance to, but alone to the power of re=
         =straining and preventing grace?
         From the time of my dear Fathers decease,
         I was convinced that the business we were
         left to conduct would never answer, and was
         very uneasy about it, but could not resolve
         to make my mind known to our guardian.
         My youngest Brother was now apprentic'd,
         but the eldest, with whom I lived, was
         unprovided for, and must in a case of

         separation, seek a situation, as he would
         have no home or employment, this thought
         cut me to the heart, as I was much attach'd
         to him, and I deferred it from time to time,
         though at the expense of peace of mind to which
         I was now, a stranger. I was distressed and
         perplexed on every side. and my burthen
         seemed frequently greater than I could bear
         the more so, as I could tell no one the real state of
         my mind. This was in the year 1788. the last
         of my residence in Brinkworth; for after long
         delay, I did, at length, propose to our guardian
         that the business should be given up, and he
         readily agreed to it. But now my distress was
         increased by the thought of my dear brother si=
         =tuation, whose comfort and happiness was in=
         =separable from my own. The danger I was in,
         became more and more evident to me, and the
         Savior demanded of me to sacrifice every thing
         however dear and near it might be, if it stood
         in the way of my souls prosperity. In the
         autumn I paid a visit to Tytherton, thinking
         I should not remove thither, till the following
         spring, but many of my intimates, who dis=
         =covered something of the anxious state of mind
         I was in, endeavored to prevail on me to come with=
         =out delay, and leave the winding up of our affairs
         to be managed by a near relative, who might stay
         with my brother until it was accomplished. I
         knew this was good advice, and wished I was
         at liberty to follow it, but it appeared utterly
         impossible, that I should leave a beloved another
         so suddenly, when I had not even told him

         what was intended: O what pangs did this
         occasion: my conscience seemed to accuse me of
         cruel treatment to one I so much loved, and the ene=
         =my of my soul loaded me with the foulest reproach=
         =es that can be imagined tillI really felt on the
         verge of destruction. But it may well be said
         that our extremity is Gods opportunity! Just at
         this critical period, He was pleased to raise me
         up a Friend, a person with whom I had no previous
         acquaintance; but whose first conversation with me
         was of such a nature that it knit my soul to
         hers, in a manner I knew nothing of before. Her
         words were as balm to my wounded spirit, her ap=
         =parent knowledge of my case, by her own experi=
         =ence, struck me with wonder and amazement.
         I was constrained to confess, "This is the Lord's do=
         =ing, and it is indeed marvelous, in my eyes."
         After repeated conversations with the same dear
         friend, and the tenderness she showed to convince
         me, that staying longer, where I was, would
         be an error, and might be more fatal to my
         peace than I was aware of. My conscience own=
         =ed, that these observations were just, but how
         to put it in practice I knew not. The flesh
         strove hard against the spirit, and I seemed
         ready to sink under the dreadful conflict!
         At length I sought a place alone, where no hu=
         =man eye could witness my distress, and fixed

         upon our little burying ground, at Tytherton, at
         that time, a most retired spot, where many an
         aching heart was poured out to Him who seeth
         in secret. Here I gave full vent to my pent up
         feelings: I wept and prayed aloud, entreating the
         Lord, to remove a burthen which was too heavy
         for me. At length, quite exhausted and overcome
         I threw my self on my grave of my dear depart=
         =ed Father, indulging for some moments an agony
         of grief which is indeed unutterable. Then falling
         prostrate, I besought our Savior to make his
         will known to me so clearly, that I could not be
         mistaken, and to give me grace and strength, to do
         what was pleasing in his sight, even though it
         was cutting off a right hand, or plucking out a
         right eye! I would then no longer consult with
         flesh and blood, but would sacrifice every human
         feeling for the enjoyment of that peace which the
         world can neither give or take away! Scarcely were
         these resolutions formed in my mind, but the friend
         of sinners drew near; and, as the good Samaritan,
         He poured oil, and wine, into my bleeding wounds,
         and verifyed his gracious promise. "In this man
         will I look, who is of a humble and contrite spi=
         =rit, and trembleth at my word." His tender love
         and compassion melted my soul like wax before
         Him; (and I thought if I had a thousand hearts;
         they should all be devoted to Him without reserve.)

         The conflict was now decided; I was at no loss
         to know His will: and I felt assured, that He would
         strengthen my weakness, so that I should be able
         to perform what He required of me, though I had
         much before me to contend with, I was aware.
         In this frame of mind, I soon returned home, and
         without delay, I informed my brother and other
         friends of my intentions. By many, I was highly
         blamed, and by some commended. But I had
         resolved, nor did I repent it. Whatever my feelings
         might suffer, I determined, by God's help to stand
         firm. He did help me; and I fixed on November
         12th. 1788. for returning to Tytherton. The Daily-
         word for that day, which I had not previously
         noticed, was remarkable; "Come and let us return
         "unto the Lord, for He hath torn, and He will heal
         "us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up."
         I was much struck with these words, they sunk
         deep into my heart. At length the day arrived when
         I was to bid adieu to my Paternal home, and to a
         much loved Brother! An old faithful servant of
         my late Fathers came on purpose to accompany
         me, and we set out together. I walked and wept.
         without uttering a word; but my heart was lift=
         =ed up to my Savior, and He supported me most
         graciously in soul and body, or I must have
         sunk under the weight that lay upon me. In
         the evening I arrived safe at Tytherton to the

         Sisters House. and met with a hearty recepti=
         =on from all my former associates, particularly
         my Dear Sister which excited gratitude and
         thankfulness. "What shall I render unto the Lord
         "for all His benefits!" The following day I had the
         favor to celebrate the solemn festival of the 13th
         of November with the Congregation. It was a day
         I never can forget, nor can I describe what pas=
         =sed within my breast: Suffice it to say, that a
         sense of the Lord's mercies to one of the most un=
         =worthy was so overwhelming, that my senses
         were confounded with amazement and Joy.
         "Shame and wonder, joy, and love;
         "These at once possessed my mind;
         "That I e'er so vile should prove,
         "And yet, forgiveness find!
         I now had to set out in life upon new ground.
         My whole maintainance, with a very trifling ex=
         =ception, must depend upon my own hands,
         which had not been the case before, and which
         with my state of health, liable to continual inter=
         =ruptions, and always delicate, I knew would
         be no easy task; and would subject me to ma=
         =ny deprivations, which my constitution and
         disposition were but little calculated to sustain.
         and in the sequel, these circumstances caused me
         many a heavy hour. Indeed, I may remark here,
         that my frequent ill health was, in these years,

         more a cause of mental suffering, than even of
         bodily pain, though the latter was often of a trivi=
         =al kind. I could however, at times, "Cast all my
         "care upon Him, who cared for me." and believe
         that all was working together for my souls good.
         And I have no doubt, but every cross was a
         needful one, designed by my Heavenly Father,
         and all wise Savior to keep me nearer to Him-
         -self. My dear Brother's care, was still a
         great weight on my mind, and embittered the
         daily comforts of my life, because I believed,
         that after he was without a proper home, his com=
         =forts were but few. In the summer of 1789 it
         pleased God to relieve both him and myself from
         this perplexity, by his being taken into the Family
         of a kind Uncle, who treated him, as his own
         child, and where he remained until his marriage.
         At the early age of 30 he was called out of
         time into eternity. My spiritual enjoyments
         were at this time, many and precious: I prized
         my lot to live again in a Sisters house, where I
         felt we were for the most part, of one heart, and
         one mind. The meetings I also valued highly,
         and can remember upon some occasions, when I
         have longed for the hour to strike which called us
         to Chapel in the evening, as much as a hungry
         stomach would desire to be fed, at the usual
         time, with a meal. I might, I think, be allowed

         and many anxious hours. I also depended too
         much upon frames and feelings. This was pre=
         =suming too much. to rely on the promises of
         God our Savior, contained in his Holy word, to con=
         =fide in Him in gloomy hours as well as light=
         =some days, and to keep the eye of faith directed
         to His complete atonement. and to that finished
         salvation, purchased for us, when He bowed His
         head, and died upon the cross, is the sinners on=
         =ly safety; for if we put any dependance in our own
         attainments of whatsoever kind they may be, we
         are misled. We are surely forsaking the fountain
         of living water. Private conversation, on spirit=
         =ual subjects, were at this time particularly needful:
         Well for me, that I had a friend who shared in
         all my concerns, and to whom I could unbosom
         my self without reserve. Indeed our love and
         confidence was mutual, and we oft took sweet
         counsel together. Besides this special favor
         conferred upon me, there were other dear friends,
         with whom I delighted to converse, whose ob=
         =servations, though perhaps, then, not so fully
         understood, were treasured up in my memory.
         and have been useful in subsequent years.

         In the spring of 1790. it was judged proper
         to establish a preparatory institution in Ty=
         =therton for the purpose, of receiving young peo=
         =ple, who applied for leave to live in the Sis=
         =ters house: and a proposal was made to me,
         with five or six others to make the beginning:
         I felt much hesitation, and would rather have
         been excused; but consented to go, in reliance
         upon the Lord. We entered our new habitation on
         the third of May, had a cheerful Love-feast on
         the occasion, and suitable instructions for our
         future plan, given us by our revered late Bro=
         =ther Thomas Moore, who was here communi=
         =cating the Synod of 1789. It was altogether
         an important period to me, and a season of
         blessing. We lived in peace and harmony in our
         dwelling, till in July 1791. I with another Sis=
         =ter removed back into the Sisters house, to which
         we had no objection. I now lived again in a Sis=
         =ters house, very comfortable tillEaster 1792.
         when I was requested to go into the room of
         Girls, and take a share in caring for them, and
         setting them a good example. In one respect
         this proposal was agreeable to my wishes, as
         my friend was overseer in the room, and would
         be my constant companion; but on the other
         hand, I felt very insufficient to take any charge
         of others, and my natural love of ease made

         made me shrink from the degree of responsi=
         bility in which this situation would involve
         me. I however saw it too important to be
         trifled with; looked to the Lord for direction,
         and was enabled to venture upon this new un=
         =dertaking under a sense of His divine help and
         support. Some time previous to this I had read
         a work describing a company of Pilgrims travel=
         =ling to Zion, and had been much pleased with it.
         These Pilgrims, it was said, had, during their
         Journey, been induced to leave the narrow path,
         and turn into a beautiful field, called the field
         of speculation. it was close by the way, smooth
         and easy to the feet, and full of delightful flow=
         =ers which they might pluck, examine, and ad=
         =mire, as much as they chose. This they did,
         till they were called to account for trespassing
         where they had no right, darkness overtook
         them, shame and confusion overwhelmed them.
         and punishment ensued, from which they could
         not escape; till a strong deliverer appeared to
         rescue them. When set at liberty, they were
         hastily, if I recollect right, obliged to descend
         a steep and rugged path into the valley of hu=
         =miliation, where at first they suffered much;
         but here the breach was restored; and their hurts
         healed. Who would not think that a represen=
         =tation like this read and considered by a re=

         reflecting mind, would be sufficient warning
         to avoid the same snare. But I completely
         followed their example. I turned aside to exam=
         =ine what was too wonderful for me, and to
         pluck flowers which I had no business so much
         as to touch; but I wandered on, presuming to
         scrutinize into the ways of God with his crea=
         =ture man, and to think his dealings unequal
         and unjust. His leadings with me, vile worm,
         I saw quite in a new light, and thought my-
         =self hardly dealt with; while others were more
         favored, both as to spirituals, and temporals.
         Pride, unbelief, and hardness of heart now
         took place in me to an alarming degree: I lost
         all confidence in God my Saviour. His dying
         love, His meritorious life, bitter sufferings,
         and all atoning death, were no longer the
         theme that engaged my affections. and melted
         my heart, but instead thereof, a train of thought
         occupied my mind which I dare not name,
         and which the grand enemy of my soul only
         could have suggested to me. No wonder that
         I fell into the pit where there is no water;
         where clouds and darkness overwhelmed me:
         darkness that might indeed be felt. I fancied
         my self forsaken of God, and rejected by man;
         insomuch that I strove to shun society as much
         as I could; for such gloom rested upon my spirit,

         spirits, that I thought the Almighty had set a mark
         upon me, as He did upon Cain, and that
         whoever should attentively observe my coun=
         =tenance would discover too much of what passed
         within. Indeed, so completely did I feel in the
         enemys power, and so harassed by his vile
         insinuations, that I thought it must be hurt=
         =ful to those about me, which made me exceed=
         =ingly concerned for the young people with
         whom I lived, and I resolved more than once
         or twice to ask to leave them again, but the
         fear of being desired to explain my self on the
         subject, deterred me; for I studiously avoided
         imparting my gloomy state of mind to any one,
         and wished to bear the burthen alone. The
         greatest relief I found was by writing verses
         occasionly, and pouring out my distress be=
         =fore the Lord as well as I was able: and
         at such times I was favored with gleams of
         hope and comfort, but they quickly vanished.
         I went to the meetings more for the sake of ex=

         it was not always done in vain. It will be sup=

         draw from me a free disclosure of what op=

         I shunned enquiries as much as possible, to

         to my own hurt and detriment. At length
         in the latter part of this memorable year 1792.
         one evening when we were alone, she expressed
         great concern on my account, adding, that my
         conduct was so strange, there must be some
         hidden cause which I would not disclose even to
         her, by which she was deprived of sharing the
         burthen with me, as she had often done before.
         This was a stroke I could not evade. But felt
         the remark in all its force. At last I owned
         that my distress was great, but to burthen
         her with it, was useless: no mortal could
         help me, and though I sought the Lord, He
         hid his face from me. She replied, You do not
         seek Him aright, you want to be helped in
         your own way; but are not willing to submit
         to His way: This is the only cause of your
         present misery. I could only reply, you
         little know how thankful I should be to find
         deliverance in any way. Her answer was, You
         would soon obtain it, if you cease from all self
         working, and cast your self, as a poor perish=
         =ing sinner at the feet of Jesus, where none
         can perish. Upon this we retired to rest.
         My friends conversation riveted itself in
         my breast: the first of it, wounded me deeply,
         but the latter clause sunk into my heart.
         It began to soften, I cried out in the anguish

         anguish of my spirit. O most merciful
         God and Savior, if thou canst, and wilt help
         me, why may I call upon thee now, and
         cast my self as a vile and perishing sinner,
         at thy through pierced feet. O that I could
         like Magdalene wash them with contrite
         tears, and like her, be assured that my many
         sins were forgiven. Mine exceed hers, by
         far, because of ungratitude for so many mer=
         =cies already received. While I thus called
         upon the Lord, in the day of trouble, He hast=
         =ened to deliver me. He did not upbraid me
         with the obstinate self will I had so long che=
         =rished. - Ah no! He spoke peace to my soul,
         which had so long been a stranger to peace.
         My trembling heart melted like wax before
         the fire, and a flood of tears gushed from my
         eyes. It was an hour of grace never to be
         forgotten, the transition from darkness to light,
         and from, "the power of Satan, unto God!" A mer=
         =ciful, and sin forgiving God. "Return, unto
         thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt
         "bountifully with thee!"
         The following Ten years of my life were mark=
         =ed with a sameness, which leaves but little
         subject for recital: I remained in the same
         situation in the girls room, and might say
         much as regarding my own imperfections

         from the only worthy object, allowing
         creature comforts and enjoyments to entwine
         their silken threads around my heart, there=
         =by robbing my Creator and Redeemer of
         what is so justly due to Him. an undivided
         heart. Alas! I must candidly confess that
         the last mentioned evil has been one of the
         sins, if not the most distinguished sin that
         hath so easily beset me during life. I
         have thereby often grieved the Spirit of God,
         and hindered the growth of grace in my own
         soul.Thus far, her own account.
         Our Sisters memory will long be held in
         affectionate rememberance, by those who knew
         her, on account of the truly sympathizing
         heart she possessed. Her sensibility indeed
         was so fine and tender, that, though in the case
         of her relatives and friends, it was the means
         of endearing her much; yet, on the other hand,
         in regard to her self, the consequence was a
         painful one. It was on this account that cir=
         =cumstances of an extraordinary occurrence
         would so wrap her mind in fearful forebodings,
         as to cause her much uneasiness. - and this
         again operating upon the nervous weakness of
         her delicate frame of body, at times because

         so powerful, as to unhinge that clearness of
         thought and judgment, which she in general
         exhibited. The nervous debility above
         alluded to, was considerably increased in
         1803. when after unremitting attention at
         the sick bed of her Brother, until his de=
         =parture. She also went to nurse an Uncle,
         when she herself was taken extremely ill,
         and it had a visible effect upon her gene=
         =ral constitution. In 1805. she received and
         accepted a call to be warden, and subsequent=
         =ly to be Laboress of the Single-Sisters Choir
         at Fairfield. In 1812. she was appointed
         to be Laboress of the Single Sisters Choir at
         Tytherton. As a guardian over the spiritu=
         =al concerns of the Family committed to
         her, our late Sister will always rank in high
         and deserved esteem. The solicitude which she
         felt in the proper discharge of her spiritual of=
         =fice, was a remarkable feature in her character,
         which not long before her dissolution, she feel=
         =ingly expressed to those who attended on her
         sick-bed, declaring, that it had always been
         her prayer, that if she should not do good to
         any soul, the Lord would preserve her from
         doing any harm; adding, that she trusted she
         had never been the means of leading one poor
         soul astray. Nor indeed was her solicitude, as

         as to the salvation of the souls confined with=
         =in the walls of her own House; no one could
         be more pleased, to hear the invitations of Jesus,
         as the Friend of sinners, closely and zealously
         pressed upon the public auditory. And in one
         of her last interviews with her medical advis=
         =er who had faithfully and assiduously attended
         upon her, for the last years of her suffering life,
         She exclaimed; "Ah, dear Sir, If I could say
         "one word for the good of your soul, I should be
         "thankful, but the Lord, alone can do that. I
         "assure you I have no goodness of my own, but
         "I trust solely in the merits of my Saviors suffering
         "and death." The blessings which she experienced
         in the more private meetings of the Congregation,
         were very dear to her; and when necessitated to
         absent her-self on account of a total inability,
         from such opportunities. - She did not fail to
         call to mind her past impressions, which proved
         a great comfort and encouragement to her. -
         But of all other meditations, that of the Atone=
         =ment of our Savior was her peculiar delight. -
         On this subject she warmly expressed on being re=
         =minded it was Good-Friday. Ah! said she,
         "What has my Dear Savior, suffered for me!
         "what are all my light sufferings when compared
         "with His: and how much reason have I to thank
         "and praise Him for His unmerited goodness." After

         After pausing a while, she exclaimed. - "It is
         "finished! Salvation's finished now! a full and
         "complete salvation has my Savior purchased for
         "me! He was forsaken of His Heavenly Father,
         "then, what wonder that I at times have felt forsak=
         "=en: but now my Savior is with me, and doth all
         "things well." Turning to those who were present,
         she added. "My Dear Sisters, never forget these
         "words. It is finished! but for these words, my
         "doubts and fears would have been too much for me.
         "But they have supported me. They have comforted

         Girls who had become Candidates for the Holy

         "this opportunity of speaking a few words previ=

         hands on her Redeemer. The departure of her only

         and added she. " Now I can say with my Dear
         "Brother, I have a desire to depart and to be with
         "Christ: which is far better." Thus the affection which
         she bore for her Brother, from being a tie to this earth;
         became an additional attraction to the Courts above;
         and only one of her Family remained to witness
         with an aching heart, the sufferings of her dying
         hour. The hope of being any more restored to comparative
         health, which had been often effected, by her skillful Me=
         =dical attendant, to the astonishment of all around her,
         became quite extinguished. His arrival being an=
         =nounced, she said. "Ah he is nothing to me now,
         "he can do me no more good. I am in my Saviors
         "Hands: As I am so take me, &amp;c. &amp;c." When
         the Doctor entered, she said, "I believe it is
         "almost over. - Don't be afraid to tell me so,
         "I long to go." He replied, Certainly Life is not de=
         =sirable, when there is continual pain of body.
         The reply was. "No. when there is a hope of a
         "happy eternity. and that hope grounded on a Savi-
         orsmerits." When asked if she was comfortable,
         She answered. "Yes, my sisters, you are very
         "kind. You do all you can, and our Savior
         "will soon do the rest.-- How delightful if we

         "What shall I feel, when I, -- the glorious

         morning

         morning of her departure, here SIster and other
         kind friendsand attendants being present. She
         intimated that it was high time for the blessing
         for departure to be pronounced upon her.-- Upon
         the Brothers entering, her surprize was appa-
         rent, in not seeing that Brother, whom she had of-
         ten in her life time, she would wish all others
         to pronounce this last solemn benediction over her.
         She was told: He was on a Visit to our Malmes-
         bury Brethren and Sisters. With great difficulty,
         she said: "I wished to have seen him, to thank him
         "for directing me to the Atonement. Thank him in my
         "Name." After the Blessing being pronounced over
         her, she expressed, what comfort, and peace of mind
         she felt.- though scarcely intelligible.- Her body
         was in a state of much anguish.-- But nowher time
         was at hand, when her released and enraptured
         Spiritwas conveyed to the bosom of her Savior,
         there like John [?] to enjoy a near participation of
         His presence, and Love, to be clothed with gar-
         mentsof white raiment, and to sing forth the
         unspeakable wonders of His grace eternally.
         She departed April 18th 1825. Her age was
         56 years, and 4 Months.
         Our late dear Sister chose herself for the sub-
         jectof her Funeral discourse that passage of
         Scripture to be found in the 7th Chpaterof
         Revelations the 13th and 14th Verses. "What
