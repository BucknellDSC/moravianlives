               <p>The Life of our <hi rend="underline">Late Sister Sarah Verney</hi> who <hi rend="underline">departed</hi> this life<hi rend="underline"> January 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                     1795</hi> who has left the following account of herself. </p>
               <p>I was born October 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1758 at Waltham Cross in the parish of Cheshunt Hertfordshire in my 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Yr. I lost my dear Mother as a
                  child I was very wild, and thought little about my Souls Salvation consequently I had no inclination to attend divine Service, to which my Father did not force me, but in other
                  respects was very strict <add>with</add> me preventing me from dressing and mixing with such company as I gladly <sic>woud</sic>
                  <corr>would</corr> have done; of course I as also my 2 Brs and Sr were obligd to keep strictly at home. In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I went to London on a visit to see
                  an acquaintance of my Fathers, who indeed appear'd very gay, and just as I <sic>coud</sic>
                  <corr>could</corr> like to be She moreover took me to see many things in London and in short gratifyd me in every thing She was able, all which pleasd me highly and made me wish to
                  leave my Fathers house, merely that I might have more liber -ty the above mentioned person also asurd me that one might very well enjoy the pleasures of this world, and yet be
                  sincere in heart, in my 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year my Father went to London on a visit, and took me along with him to B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gibb's who wishd that
                  I might stay a while with them of which I was very glad, hoping it <sic>woud</sic>
                  <corr>would</corr> prove the means of my getting entirely away from home, the next Sunday Sr Gibbs took me to the B.<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Chapel which I dislikd very much,
                  as that was not the way I wishd to steer my course, She next took me to see the S.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">le Srs</hi></hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="2">
               <head type="page" ana="MCH/MemLon_300047-02">2</head>
               <p>who treated me with much love, so that I in time got a love for the People of the Brn tho I had nothing in my heart, and as I frequented some of the meetings, and also kept up a
                     <sic>conexion</sic>
                  <corr>connection</corr> with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> I got more and more love for them, and at last found myself very happy among them, so that I thought I had now
                  obtaind every thing, and simply related my happiness to any one to whom I had an opportunity of doing it, but once during a Sermon of the late B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                  LasTrobes concerning the Sin of unbelief, I was all at once convinc'd that I by nature was full of Sin and misery, this being quite the contra- -ry to what I had so lately felt and
                  thought of myself it made me quite ashamed to speak to any of those with whom I had formerly conversd thinking they woud look upon me as nothing but a hypocrite, this brought on a
                  reservedness, which lasted many Years, so that I spent my time in continual heaviness, keeping every thing to myself, I discoverd more and more how deeply I was Spoild by Sin, of
                  which I felt <sic>powerfull</sic>
                  <corr>powerful</corr> stirring with me, I had also many Struggles with regard to the Cong.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and the world, wishing at times to give myself up entire_ ly
                  to our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, and at other times to follow my natural inclination in the world, but all this I kept to myself thinking if I disclosd the bad things I
                  felt, I shoud be deprivd of all <sic>conexion</sic>
                  <corr>connection</corr> with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and if I told the good desires of my heart, I shoud be thought a hypocrite and thus I reasond within myself Year
                  after Year, in my 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year as I was at the G.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sabbath lovefeast, my heart was very dark, I thought there coud be no truth in
                  our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> being a Corpse, and began to think we were decievd in the whole affair, but as I for pondering over it, and supposd it might be time, I began

               <head type="page" ana="MCH/MemLon_300047-03">3</head>
               <p>to be frighten'd at myself, thinking how wou'd it be with me in this unbelieving way, shou'd my Soul be calld out of this world, this occasion'd me to Sigh to our Sav.<hi
                     rend="superscript">r</hi> O that I cou'd but believe, no sooner had this sigh burst from my heart, but it was as if our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> appear'd before me in his
                  Corpse's figure, and asur'd me that it was on <del>my</del> account of my Sins that He had <sic>sufford</sic>
                  <corr>suffered</corr> and dy'd and that he had thereby procur'd peace and <sic>forgivness</sic>
                  <corr>forgiveness</corr> for me, this was accompanied with such a di -vine feeling of peace that I shall never forget it. I had also several other particular visits of grace, all
                     w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I kept quite to myself, notwithstanding the great love and kindness I experienc'd from my Labouress, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to open my
                  heart, and at such <sic>opportunitys</sic>
                  <corr>opportunities</corr> cou'd only give vent to tears, which made her think I must have something very particular upon my mind. In my 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I went
                  to learn the Tambour work in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                  <hi rend="underline">House</hi>, and as I look'd upon them to be good S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> it was of us to me, as they were one day in boundlike conversation among
                  themselves to find that they also felt such things as I did which help'd to remove the load under which I had labour'd so many years, after this I had a desire to move en- -tirely
                  into the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House at London, which I however cou'd not get leave for, but it was made out for me to go to Fulneck into the Choirhouse there, this was a
                  great trial for me, hearing so much of the poverty there besides leaving all my friends and acquaintances, but our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> enabled me to resolve to live for
                  him, and in the place he had appointed, show'd I even have to live upon bread and water, I accordingly arriv'd in Fulneck March 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1779 and found
                  contrary to my expectation </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="4">
               <head type="page" ana="MCH/MemLon_300047-04">4</head>
               <p>every thing very comfortable; and trusting in our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I never wanted for any thing; the first year of my abode here, I met with some difficulties, but
                  the nearness of our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> comforted me, He not only made it clear to me that I was in my right place, but he made me sensible that every trial I met with
                  was with a view to establish <add place="above">me in</add> his grace, thus I took all wish resignation as out of his hands. Oct.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 11<hi
                     rend="superscript">th</hi> that same year I had the favor to be reci<hi rend="underline">ev'd into the Cong.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and December 2<hi rend="superscript"
                        >d</hi></hi> 1780 to be admitted for the first time to the Holy born after which I spent 5 years very comfortably in the <hi rend="underline">Ch: house</hi>. April 4<hi
                     rend="superscript">th</hi> 1785 I mov'd to the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oecon at Wyke to live with the G. G.r there, the beginning of my living there was attended with some
                  difficulties, but in time they were remov'd, and we liv'd happily together in the nearness of our dear Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> till at a certain period I gave way to
                  reasoning concerning the Labourers, and our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> leading in the Cong.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> into which I enter'd so far that I lost <del>??</del>
                  sight of our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and of my call to the Cong.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, thinking I might as well live somewhere else, this brought me into great
                  distress as I knew not which way to do, nor cou'd I speak of my distress to any one for a while, till S.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anna Turos from Fulneck paid us a visit, I
                  open'd my whole mind to her, she treated me with much love, which was a comfort to me, but still I found no real help, my distress still encreas'd, and I began to think, was it
                  possible that I cou'd ever come into a happy simple track again, or was I gone too far, which indeed seem'd to be my case, so that I was <sic>thankfull</sic>
                  <corr>thankful</corr> when I felt a wish, and cou'd sigh to our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for help, thinking he </p>

               <p>perhaps woud return to me, as he had done at various other times, but he found best to hide his face from me for near a year, thus I spent that time in heaviness often praying in the
                  distress of my Soul for another look of his grace, thinking at every meeting I went to, perhaps this wou'd be the favor'd time, but he delay'd it till by means of the last Synodal
                  letter to the Cong.<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> he granted me to see myself in the right light, worse indeed than any <add place="above">of those</add> over whom I had reason'd He
                  also gave me grace to be <sic>truely</sic>
                  <corr>truly</corr> a sinner before him and he in mercy forgave me anew, but I cannot express in words how asham'd I was, and <sic>truely</sic>
                  <corr>truly</corr> abas'd before him on account of my unfaithfulness in that respect, but it had that blessed effect, that I <add place="above">and since the end of 1759 I lived in a
                     very happy communion with him</add> Kept more sinnerlikely to him afterwards, Sep.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29 1790 I rec'd a call to enter into the mar.<hi rend="superscript"

                  felt myself for this office, yet I felt a dearness to accept of it, we were accordingly mar.<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Oct.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript"
