            <p> The single <persName>Sister Martha Ashly</persName>. She wrote of herself as follows:<lb /> I am born the <date>21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 1736</date>. at
                  <placeName>Stornhill near Wike</placeName>. &amp; brought up in the <abbr>engl.</abbr> Church. In my Childhood I heard the Brethren <sic>testyfying</sic>; <corr>testifying</corr> the
               tender Love of our Saviour that I got a deep Impression therefrom in my Heart; but this, by <sic>myn</sic>; <corr>my</corr> unsettled state of Mind, soon faded away. Till the Time when

               happy Child. I never shall forget the blessed Time among us Children, <sic>especialy</sic>; <corr>especially</corr> what feelings </p>

            <p> we had in our Meetings. <date><abbr>A.</abbr> 49</date> I came among the Girls, &amp; there I had a particular School, till I turned <del>with</del>
               <add>in</add> all my spoiled Constitution towards my <abbr>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</abbr> &amp; so gave me anew to him as a poor reward for his Sufferings. In this Situation I
               remained as long as I was among the Girls &amp; the feelings of our dear Saviours Love conducted me through all the following Occurrences. The <date>13 of August 1751.</date> Was I
               received into the Congregation &amp; after <add>a</add> long wishing &amp; longing I was <date><abbr>A.</abbr> 55. the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of <abbr>Jan.</abbr></date>
               admitted to the holy Sacrament. What I <sic>feeld</sic>; <corr>felt</corr> thereby is inexpressible for me. the <date>4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May a.e.</date> I came among
               the single Sisters, by this Opportunity I <sic><abbr>deleiverd</abbr></sic><abbr>; </abbr><corr><abbr>deliverd</abbr></corr> myself so as I was, to the Property of my Lord &amp; wished
               now to live in the Choir- House, My sickly Constitution was an Obstacle in my Wish however <del>my Desire</del>
               <date><abbr>A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. 60.</abbr></date> I obtained my Desire. Here now the holy Ghost begun to show to me my marred &amp; in the Bottom spoiled Nature, this made
               in the Beginning many perplexed Hours to me &amp; spoiled many a Happiness which I was to enjoy into our Choir-House; However about that to he comforted me in a very rich Measure, I
               acknowledged myself as a poor <sic>Siner</sic>; <corr>Sinner</corr>, so as I was &amp; begun quite at a new with my Bridegroom. Now I perceive that our Saviour begins to hasten to
               finish my poor Soul &amp; that is the Point of all my hearty Wishes&quot;. So far She herself. Our dear Sister was sickly a long Time, but behaved herself very patient &amp; complained
               about nothing, as when her Heart not according to her Wish was in Conversation <abbr>w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></abbr>. our <abbr>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</abbr>

            <p> At last She begun to grow weary, then since the Time her Sickness begun, she saw 8 of her Choir-fellows going home &amp; said to her Choir-Labourer: &quot;Will my dear Saviour not soon
               come &amp; take me along to him? I can&#39;t tell ye how <sic>gratiously</sic>; <corr>graciously</corr> he assisted me, as well in my <sic>bodyly</sic>; <corr>bodily</corr> &amp; Souls
               Occurrences; I&#39;ll leave it over to him, when he the Moment thinks proper to take my poor Soul home. And in this happy Situation She expected from the pale Lips her last kiss; whom
               She received to Day in the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Year of her Age. </p>
