                  Here followed the <date>22nd of March</date>&nbsp;our<br />
                  dear <placename><persname>Sister Benigna Briant</persname></placename>.<br />
                  She was born the <date>17th of December 1707</date> at <placename>Syneham in&nbsp;<br />
                     Wilshire</placename>. Her Parents have been of the <orgname>Quaker Religion</orgname><br />
                  &amp; She was brought up in the same Principles.<br />

                  Preachings begun, She &amp; her Husband went to hear him<br />
                  but Both got such an Impression at first that they offered<br />
                  <persname>Br. lennick?&nbsp;</persname>their house for for a Preaching Place, that was<br />
                  &nbsp;not all but they offered every Body who came to hear him<br />
                  to harbour free. They bought at last a House &amp; provided<br />
                  a Silence to preach therein.This <sic>occonomie (economy)</sic> continued&nbsp;<br />
                  many years, without finding hereby any Rest for their<br />

                  in Danger of her Life. To the same Time it happened&nbsp;<br />
                  that a certain Man was so<trait> enraged</trait> about <persname>B</persname><persname><persname>r.</persname>&nbsp;lennicks?&nbsp;</persname><br />
                  Preachings from the Blood of Christ, that he made a<br />

                  Auditory guide overstream with Blood of Oxen.<br />
                  But this Man on a Sudden became <trait>mad</trait> &amp; clear Blood<br />
                  ran out of his nose &amp; Mouth &amp; this continued several&nbsp;<br />
                  weeks under extraordinary <trait>Pain</trait>, his terrible &amp; furious&nbsp;<br />
                  Sooth made, that nobody would venture to come near&nbsp;<br />
                  him,<br />
                  ///<br />
                  till he at last with <trait>Howling &amp; bawling</trait> went to Eternity.<br />
                  All his Companions found in some Way or other by &amp; by a<br />
                  comendable End. In this restless Time, <persname>B</persname><persname><persname>r.</persname> Briant</persname>&nbsp;<br />

                  taken by the Grace of Christ among them, that he on&nbsp;<br />
                  his Retour testifyed it to his dear Wife to a great Im-<br />
                  pression of her Heart. She directly <sic>begg&#39;d&nbsp;</sic>him that he<br />
                  would invite the Brethren to Wilshire, which done&nbsp;<br />
                  according to the general Desire of the awakened Souls&nbsp;<br />
                  in this Parts. <persname>B</persname><persname><persname>r</persname>. Schlicht</persname>&nbsp;was the first after <persname>B</persname><persname><persname>r. </persname>lennick?&nbsp;</persname><br />
                  who was sent <sic>thiter (thither)</sic>, his Testamony of Christ found Applause&nbsp;<br />
                  &amp; our <persname>Sister&nbsp;</persname>declared herself: for this Preachings of the&nbsp;<br />
                  Sake of our Saviour I venture my All. Now begun&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                  her Period wherein our Saviour begun to draw nearer&nbsp;<br />
                  to her Heart, her natural Fire begun by Degrees to&nbsp;<br />
                  dye &amp; the holy Ghost brought her in his School to a&nbsp;<br />
                  more childlike &amp; yielding Temper. As our <persname>Mr. Johanes</persname>&nbsp;<br />
                  <date>1748 the 9 of May</date> in <placename>Buttermere</placename>&nbsp;the Congregation&nbsp;<br />
                  errected she was baptiseth by him in the Death of&nbsp;<br />
                  Christ by the Name Benigna &amp; that was her Name&nbsp;<br />
                  by right &amp; the <date>22nd of September</date>&nbsp;a.c. She was admitted to&nbsp;<br />
                  the holy Sacrament to a real &amp; remaining Blessing for her Heart.<br />
                  She lived 7 Miles distant of us, but surely came every<br />
                  Sunday to our Preaching &amp; that 6 years, till she removed<br />
                  with her Husband to <placename>Bath</placename>. Here she entertained the Brethren&nbsp;<br />
                  as formerly which just now begun to visit and preach<br />
                  in<br />

               <p>
                  in this Parts, with all imaginable Tenderness &amp; wish&#39;d<br />
                  nothing more as that the Brethren would settle in this&nbsp;<br />
                  Place. In the meantime She &amp; her Husband visited diligently<br />
                  at Bristol till 1757. a Society was errected at Bath.<br />
                  Her House was the Residence of our Labourer &amp; She<br />
                  made it her Pleasure to serve them. Our Saviour&nbsp;<br />
                  blessed her marrigage with 6 children, whereof 4 is&nbsp;<br />
                  ready by our Lord &amp; the rest is in the Care of the&nbsp;<br />
                  Congregation. Our blessed Sister had extra ordinary<br />
                  Gifts of our Saviour. Her skillfull &amp; understanding&nbsp;<br />
                  Behaviour, &amp; the Maintainance of so many, of her poor&nbsp;<br />
                  Nighbours, which She with a willing Heart took upon<br />
                  her, caused that every Body loved &amp; respected her.<br />
                  Her Heart hung on our Saviours, &amp; his Death &amp; Suffering,<br />
                  was the most delightfull object of her Soul.<br />
                  By the last visit of Mr. &amp; Sister Nilshman on this Place<br />
                  She came among the Hourly Intercessors, which was<br />
                  a real Blessing to her &amp; She came never from her&nbsp;<br />
                  Conversation Hour with our Saviour without Tears<br />
                  in her Eyes. I was with Plesure to behold how She&nbsp;<br />
                  from Day so became more tender &amp; intimate with her &nbsp;<br />
                  only Friend &amp; bloody Breidegroom of her Soul! Scarcely&nbsp;<br />
                  could a Body him name to her, then her Tears of<br />
                  Love begun to flow. As She in June was in Bristol<br />
                  She said: &quot;Now I come not more hither, till I am to<br />
                  be buryed here.&quot; the 13th She enjoyd our Lords Supper<br />
                  the last time, &amp; not long after She was forced to lay down<br />
                  &amp; as&nbsp;<br />
                  ///<br />
                  it could be guessd; that She would get the Smal Pox.<br />
                  One of her Daughters did all She could to hinder that her&nbsp;<br />
                  Dear Mother should not be perplept about it; to which&nbsp;<br />
                  She said: &quot;My dear Child, why should I be afraid thereof,<br />
                  Our Saviour must take one Say or another to promote my<br />
                  Departing from this dying Body, if it is by this Way<br />
                  his holy Will, that&#39;s all one to me.&quot; May he only give<br />
                  me Patience, then my most happy Lot is to be with<br />
                  him. the 16th of March, the Smal-Pox became visible,<br />
                  She defyneth her Husbandto absent himelf because<br />
                  he had not to, &amp; declard to him that she was quite<br />
                  resignd into the Hill of our Saviour. The following&nbsp;<br />
                  Day came her Daughter from Bristol to see her, to&nbsp;<br />
                  which she related the blessed Situation her was in.<br />
                  The 21st as Sr. Miller asked her: if She intented<br />
                  to go home. She replied: yes, that I will, if it is&nbsp;<br />
                  the Pleasure of my Saviour to fetch me. There is no<br />
                  Misunderstanding between me &amp; him. Her Pain<br />
                  She endured with astonishing Patience &amp; said:<br />
                  What&#39;s that little Skinmark in Proportion to what our&nbsp;<br />
                  Saviour endured for my Sake. The Night following<br />
                  a great Alteration happened by her. Her Daughter<br />
                  inquired: Mommy will you really go home? &quot;Yes replied&nbsp;<br />
                  She.&quot; but I must first see some Br. &amp; Sisters.&quot;<br />
                  She then went for Br. &amp; Sr. Miller but as they came<br />
                  she found her Preachless allready. They kept her a&nbsp;<br />
                  pretty Liturge &amp; under these Words: Der konig&nbsp;<br />
                  wende fich yu dir, und deine narde riech &amp; flew<br />

                  her happy Soul into the Bosom of her bloody Bride&nbsp;<br />
                  groom. In the 56th Year of her Age Her Husband&nbsp;<br />
                  who had in his Sleep an Instinct of her<br />
                  Departure, said as he awaked to the People in the House:<br />
                  My Wife is gone, fell down on his Face &amp; thanked our&nbsp;<br />
                  dear Saviour for all the Blessings bestowed on her. Soon<br />
                  after that, Mr. Miller came before his Door &amp; sung:&nbsp;<u>Ihi<br />
                     Mund ist mun erblasset in Jesu Arm is School</u>, as<br />
                  the 25th was her Corps upon her Desire brought to&nbsp;<br />
                  Bristol &amp; these intered.<br />
                  the 25th Br. Rogers did the Act of his Function as&nbsp;<br />
                  Mr. Chapmann&#39;s Vicar performed the Prayer of the<br />
                  english Church in the Church at Bath &amp; preach&#39;d the<br />
