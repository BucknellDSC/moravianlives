                  their Heart<br />
                  <br />
                  Depart this Life.<br />

                  I. I. <persname>Henr. Unger</persname> as Ober Peyle the 3 of this Month.<br />
                  He was born the <date>25th of Jan. 1721&nbsp;</date>at <placename>B</placename><placename>erthelsdorf</placename><br />
                  Our Saviour made a Pretension&nbsp;on his Heart from<br />
                  his youth and he was embarrassed how to become<br />
                  happy but did not know how to find Rest for&nbsp;<br />
                  his poor Soul, till at last he hear by the Brethren<br />
                  in <placename>Peterswalde</placename><b>&nbsp;</b>of our Saviours Love to poor Sinners<br />
                  became thereby convinced &amp; deplored grace through his<br />
                  Wounds. He was as well in relation to his Body as his<br />
                  Mind a object of commiseration. By all that<br />
                  our saviour bestowed Mercy on him and he was<br />
                  <date>Ao 1746 the 29th of Jan.&nbsp;</date>in our congregation&nbsp;<br />
                  received. Few years after he became indifferent<br />
                  and by &amp; by hardhearted, so that the Brethren&nbsp;<br />
                  were forced to excommunicate him from their&nbsp;<br />
                  Society &amp; let him go on in his own Ways.<br />
                  <date>Ao 1750&nbsp;</date>he marryed <persname>Ana Rosine Shabel</persname> &amp;&nbsp;<br />
                  with three children, one of them is gone home &amp;<br />
                  two are in the care of the congregation.<br />
                  After that he returned again very perplexed about his&nbsp;<br />
                  misdeed
               </p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  misdeed and begged forgiveness with many fears,&nbsp;<br />
                  and devireth the Congregation would intercide&nbsp;<br />
                  by our Saviours, to bestow mercy on him, as<br />
                  a poor creature who brought all they <trait>miserys</trait><br />
                  and <trait>unhappiness&nbsp;</trait>on himself. Our Saviour<br />
                  mercy as he is grantedhis desire and gave leave<br />
                  to absolve him from all his sins!<br />
                  <date>1752 the 9th of April</date>&nbsp;he got the grave to pertake<br />
                  on our Lords Supper, whereby his heart melted<br />
                  with 1000 tears. The <date>20th October</date>&nbsp;he got leave<br />
                  to move to Ober Peile and soon to Gnadenfrey.<br />
                  But in the time following he came here in such a&nbsp;<br />
                  Confusion of hind and a distraction of his senses<br />
                  that he removed to <placename>Ober Peyle</placename> again. But our<br />
                  Saviour whose eye was fixed on him didnt forsake<br />
                  him, but showed mercy on him again, he<br />
                  bowed down as a sinner for his feet and in so<br />
                  he was readmitted again to the graces of the<br />
                  Congregation. Since two year he became quite<br />
                  contract, so that he neither go or stirr, every<br />
                  Brother who came to see him was a real comfort<br />
                  to him, however our Saviour and his Congregation<br />
                  shortened and diminished his bodly Pain and smart.<br />
                  Several days passed his end seemed to be pretty near,<br />
                  so that he was not more able to speak,&nbsp; but he<br />
                  recovered himself and said: poor as I am! One view<br />
                  in his wounds can bring me again, but as a sinner<br />
                  ///<br />
                  I&#39;ll go home. Today a Brethern came to so see him and he was<br />
                  just on the Brink <del>of</del>&nbsp;to go home, he sung some<br />
                  verses under which he went to our Saviour in<br />
                  the 43. Year of his Age.<br />
                  II The marryed Swt. <persname>Rosine Taneberger.</persname><br />
                  She was Ao. 1708 born at <placename>Mankendorf in Moravia</placename>.<br />
                  Her Vaters name was <persname>Geo. Weber</persname>. The holy<br />
                  ghost had from her tender youth his work in<br />
                  her Heart and she spent her time continually<br />
                  without rest in her soul. In her 25th year<br />
                  of Age she marryed <persname>Michel Taneberger</persname>. She<br />
                  2 boys with him but they died very young. She<br />
                  very often pineth to hear the gospel of Jesus<br />
                  sufferings of Death, therefore she often begged dear<br />
                  God to slice her Desire and helo her to a Place where<br />
                  sher could find rest for her poor sould, then she could<br />
                  not find that in her Mother Country. <date>Ao. 1753 the 13th October</date><br />
                  she got a feeling in her Heart to move to <placename>Gnaden</placename>&nbsp;<br />
                  frey, they happened as much as possible and leaped<br />
                  hardly from their Pursers. The <date>31 of Dec.</date>&nbsp;<br />
                  the arrived here very much rejoyced. Soon after<br />
                  a critical occasion pretty nearly persuadeth<br />
                  her Husband to remove from here to his son.<br />
                  She therefore was so embarassed and intreated our<br />
                  Saviour in her perplexity saying: Scarce my Heart catched a part<br />
                  of grace, and instead to become a fire he will be quenched.
