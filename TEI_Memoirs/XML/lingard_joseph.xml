                  the <date>29th of March</date> was a blessed Lovefeast after the<br />
                  Burying of <persname>Brother Joseph Lingard</persname>, for<br />
                  the whole Society. He was born in <date>1680</date>. in the <placename>Parish&nbsp;<br />
                     of Glossop&nbsp;</placename>in the <placename>County of Derby</placename> . He was brought&nbsp;<br />
                  in the high <orgname>Church of Engelland</orgname>&nbsp;. In <date>1729</date> he marryed<br />
                  the present Widdow, and had with her one son and one<br />
                  Daughter (which last lived here in the Choir-Hause)<br />

                  In the great Awakening which happened here round<br />
                  about in the <date>Year 1743</date>. our Brethern and his Wife became<br />
                  concerned to about their <sic><trait>happiness</trait></sic>. <date>Ao 44</date> was he<br />
                  first aquainted with the Brethren and as the same year<br />
                  our <persname>Brethern<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Okerthaufsen</persname> was put in prison for our Saviors.<br />
                  Sake, he and some Brethren more had the Happinefs<br />
                  to partake on his reproach of scorn for the Gospel of&nbsp;<br />
                  Christ. The preachings were kept in his House; but<br />
                  as his Son came of Age he became the Cause, that<br />
                  it must be left. Our Brother was of very few words,<br />
                  not <trait>talketive</trait> at all; however he loved the Brethern<br />
                  with whom he was assembled so well and dearly, that he<br />
                  very seldom stayed at home, notwithstanding<br />
                  he had above three Miles to walk; and an his last<br />
                  sickness he expressed himself thee about? as little&nbsp;<br />
                  he sometimes understood, what the said or sung, for<br />
                  all that he was a praying to our Savior that he would<br />
                  let him partake on their blessing and this was richly<br />
                  bestowed on him. He once met <persname>Brethern Bohler</persname> on the Road<br />
                  to <placename>Brafsington</placename>, and brough him the first time about&nbsp;<br />
                  this Place, whereover, he rejoiced still in this last<br />
                  Days. He visited the <orgname>Congregation in Fullnek</orgname> several<br />
                  times and felt a call in his Heart to seek his abode<br />
                  in this Congregation. But this was not sooner<br />
                  performed while he was persuaded by his son, to&nbsp;<br />
                  give over to him his whole estate, however as soon&nbsp;<br />
                  as he consented, the son pulled down his dwellinghome<br />
                  that he was forced as it were to seek his shelter at <placename>Dukenfield</placename>.<br />
               </p>

               <p> 
                  <placename>Dukenfield.</placename> Whereover he shortly before his End, declared<br />
                  himself towards his son. I lived above 80 years in this<br />
                  world, and have done nothing better, as my going to<br />
                  <placename>Dukenfield</placename>; and you never have done anymore good<br />
                  for me: then to pull down my Dwellings.&nbsp;<br />
                  He came hither as a stranger, with his wife and daughter<br />
                  with a stick in his hand, without knowing where to<br />
                  find a place of his abode; but a brother took him to<br />
                  long in his house, till we could provide a lodging<br />
                  for him. He now was very <trait>glad</trait> to find for himself under<br />
                  the People of God. To be recieved into the Blessings of<br />
                  the Congregation he must stay very long, however <date>1759</date>.<br />
                  he was with his wife and daughter recieved into the Congregation<br />
                  and <date>1760</date> was admitted to our dear Lords Supper. With<br />
                  he took for his highest treasure in this world. His bodily<br />
                  Constitution was very strong, but since 2 years his strength<br />
                  <sic>decreased&nbsp;</sic>very <sic>remarkable</sic>&nbsp;and he begun to pine for<br />
                  his eternal Reff. In his last <sic>sickness,&nbsp;</sic>he was very&nbsp;<br />
                  certain that his <trait>Desire&nbsp;</trait>would be soon fulfilled.&nbsp;<br />
                  His Patience contented Contemplations has been every<br />
                  Body who saw him to admiration. Every Body&nbsp;<br />
                  <sic>liked&nbsp;</sic>to be with him and therefore rather thronged them<br />
                  selves which Brother was to watch him. The <trait>Happyness</trait><br />
                  of his Heart spread itself from it so that every Stranger<br />
                  could percieve what our Saviour has done on this old<br />
                  Vater. After he had blessed his Wife and Daughter and recommended&nbsp;<br />
                  them.
