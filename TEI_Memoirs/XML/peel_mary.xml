               <p>I was born at Northarm in the parish of Halifax 
                  in the year <add>May 29</add> 1722. My Parents being very religious 
                  endeavour'd to bring me up strictly in the fear of God. 
                  they very early perceiving my natural turn to be <del>???</del> quick livly 
                  and active, on that account took the greater care of me takeing 
                  me with them constantly to the Decenters meetings, as I at that 
                  time did not understand their meaning, I look upon it as being 
                  very hardly dealt with, but afterwards san clearly that their 
                  intentions where only to prevent my entrance on a very loose course 
                  of life which I might have fall'n into, had not their unwearied 
                  care &amp; faithfullness, been a great means of preserving me, together 
                  with an invisible Hand, which I often felt while very young over 
                  me without any knowlidge of the meaning thereof for which I 
                  shall forever remain thankfull, I went on much in this way 
                  till Mr Inham came to these parts, to whose preaching the 
                  greatest part of the people resorting, I went among the rest, being 
                  thereby stir'd up &amp; often brought to reflect on my state, but with 
                  out any lasting impression. I remember one night being very 
                  thoughtfull when going to bed, I dream'd that I was to be put to 
                  death, at which I was very much perplex't, I intreated to be spar'd 
                  while I was set to die. The earnestness I was in awoke me, 
                  but the impression of this I never lost, &amp; by means of the uncom- 
                  mon feelings I had somtimes I thought surly there was some 
                  thing to be injoy'd, to which I was as yet a stranger, but was 
                  not rightly satisfy'd to be without it. 
                  In the year 17 the Brethern <del>???</del> <add>came</add> into Yorkshire with a 
                  vein <del>intention</del> to settle societies, accordingly tookdown the names of 
                  those who constantly atended the preaching. I therefore was willing 
                  to have mine taken down, which was no sooner done, but I was 
                  amazingly struck, thinking I am now however fast, but did not 
                  repent it. I soon found it was not done the taking down the </p>

               <p>ames but they entended to look more particularly after each one 
                  therefore they soon settled Bands to which I was admitted &amp; geting 
                  a great love for them they were very much bless to me. Some of my 
                  Companions being soon after this receiv'd into the Congregation it 
                  Cause'd me many uneasy hours, as I was left, however I thought 
                  to try &amp; get to them though I knew not how to set about it, when almost 
                  dispairing I often felt exceedingly encouraged and very much strengthened 
                  I was not allow'd to go to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> meetings this drove me to the 
                  determination to make my mind known which I did by a letter 
                  to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> expressing my greatest desire to be embody'd with them. 
                  My request was soon granted our in year 1745 this was an inex- 
                  -pressible grace &amp; favour to me past discribing being then very 
                  chearfull I thought I had then got all that could make my happiness 
                  compleat. In this way I went on for some time. 
                  In the year 1747 the first Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy was settl'd at Oxhaighs I 
                  having the favour to be one of the first, I look'd on it &amp; accepted it with 
                  a real thankfull heart, &amp; the blessing which I then enjoy'd well never 
                  be forgot by me. This happiness lasted for some time but before I was 
                  aware it all vanishd away and I was left as much distresst as ever 
                  being ready to determin to leave the Sisrs &amp; take my thing in the world but my Consionec would not permit me to such 
                  on this account I often whr'd to a lonly place, which I had found 
                  quite to my mind, then I often lamented my state without the least 
                  hopes of being helpt through, &amp; sav'd at last but my best &amp; faithfull 
                  friend notwithstanding my negligence followed me endeavouring 
                  to bring me to the place where I at all times bught to have a remaind 
                  er at his feet, he thererfore took an Oppertunity to shen me my state 
                  by nature &amp; convincd me that noself working would avail me any 
                  thing, but he was willing to take my care on himself. I was hereby 
                  quite overcome, by his asuring me I was his, which so worked on me 
                  that I was determin'd to be his intirly with soul &amp; body, and as a poor 
                  Sinner to receive grace at his hand. </p>

               <p>My longing was now daily increased to become a partaker of the 
                  Holy Sacrement which grace was granted me Nov 1747 after 
                  which I believd simply I should yeild more satisfaction to the 
                  Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; my self. These thoughts brought me into a very loyal 
                  way but could not with my best endeavours effect what I wish for, 
                  and having no Laboress at that time to help &amp; encourage as, 
                  I thought to direct myself, but not being able this way only brought 
                  me into confusion. At last I was convinc'd that even those who were 
                  partakers of his body &amp; blood could lay up no store without a 
                  daily &amp; hourly supply from the fountain from whence all good 
                  springs. Therefore I determin'd to be directed and influenced 
                  alone by him who has often approv'd himself as my friend in need. 
                  Chearfully &amp; satisfy'd then there being a new Oeconomy began 
                  at Littlemoore. I was one that was place'd there where I learnd 
                  to know mroe of myself and the leading of our Saviour with me 
                  then I was sensible of before. In the year 50 I mov'd again 
                  to the Oeconomy at Conhouse, where I thought to live Chearfully 
                  with the rest of my Companions. But here I must observe 
                  I was again disturb'd by my own Corruption of which I thought 
                  I had sufficient knowledge <add>before</add> but found the depth of my natural 
                  Corrupted heart was unfathomable which made me almost 
                  conclude it was uppossible for me to be help to the end of days 
                  <del>?????????</del>. I was often encouraged by those about me to 
                  believe I was not to bad for our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but to not purpose, till I 
                  felt it scals &amp; made clear to my heart by my best friend. He 
                  often took such oppertunities as these to melt &amp; bow my heart before 
                  him amen, &amp; thereby to make my call &amp; diction of grace of greater 
                  value to me. The same year the Oeconomy mov'd to Fulneck 
                  there to reside till the Choir house which was their <del>in</del> building,</p>

               <p>was finish'd, into which as soon as it was ready, I mov'd with 
                  the first company, at the entrance of which I again renew'd 
                  my Covenenat with my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and partook of the grace 
                  which in a particular manner prevail'd at that time. 
                  here as well as in all other places &amp; during my whole life 
                  <del>during</del> <add>notwithstanding</add> all failings wants &amp; defects I was alway follow'd 
                  and often comforted by him who has alway approv'd himself 
                  as my only effectual Comforter &amp; Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. So he will continue 
                  to me to the end of my days. he has often been so visibly near 
                  my heart as if I had seen him with my bodily eyes, yea I could 
                  Converse with him as with an intimate friend about every 
                  thing. In the year 1760 I had a Call to go to Bedford, as 
                  it was thought best I went out of Obedience at which place 
                  I was receiv'd with so much love &amp; heartiness as I can't express 
                  but I have often reflected on it with thankfullness, so far Her own words 
                  but meeting with difficulties of various sorts, the employment 
                  for which I went there not answering the wish for end, 
                  and having a great desire to return to Fulneck, as my 
                  Bodily Health was also much impair'd I made my desire 
                  Known, which after Consideration was consented too &amp; I refused

                  faithfullness till thro bodily circumstances she was oblig'd to retire into the Choir 
                  through there but finding Her <add>no better</add> <del>weakness increase</del> She defin'd &amp; obtaind  leave 
                  to remove back again to The Choir House in Fullneck where she arriv'd Feb 16 1770</p>
