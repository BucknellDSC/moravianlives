                  When I review my mispent
                  days, I feel a heavy burden, Reflecting on my trespasses, I scarce could hope
                  for pardon, But should be
                  hopeless and forlorn, Uncertain where for help to
                  turn.   If I had not thy
                  promise. But thy
                  reviving Gospel word
                  which leads me to salvation Doth joy unspeakable afford. And lasting
                  consolation: This tells me
                  thou wilt not disdain
                  A broken heart reflects
                  with pain, That turns to

                  thee, O Jesus.
                  This is the language
                  of my heart, when about to
                  call to mind the mercies
                  which the Lord has vouchsafed unto me.
                  I was born in <placeName>London</placeName>
                  <date>1764</date>, and baptized in the
                  Established Church. When
                  young I attended the meetings in the Brethren's
                  Chapel and received powerful impressions of our
                  Saviour's love.
                  My dear Mother's anxious
                  care for my spiritual welfare, her good advice and
                  prayers, proved even in my

                  childhood a blessing: and in
                  after periods of my life, were
                  a check to me, and through
                  mercy, the means of preserving me from many troubles.
                  In <date>April 178</date>1, I went
                  to live in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House in
                  <placeName>Fulneck</placeName>, and was at that
                  time really intent upon
                  living to our Saviour
                  alone. - I soon felt at
                  home, loved my companions
                  and was very happy:
                  but found that I had
                  much to learn of the depravity of my heart -
                  I was much [?] at
                  this discovery, But most  
               </p>
            </div>
            
            <div type="page" n="5">
               <head type="page" ana="MCH/MemLon_300034-05">5</head>
               <p>      
                  earnestly prayed our Saviour
                  to have mercy upon me, and
                  if it was his will, to take
                  me to himself, rather than
                  suffer me to prove unfaithful.
                  He kindly heard &amp; [?]
                  [?] me though not in
                  my way. I laboured to
                  gain a particular clearness of the forgiveness of my
                  sins, which our Saviour
                  did not grant me all at
                  one :| but yet I knew
                  he died for me, &amp; could
                  not think <hi rend="underscore">he</hi> would
                  suffer me a poor sinner
                  to be lost, while crying to
                  him for mercy -.My

               <p> 
                  constant thought was -
                  "If I do perish, it shall be at
                  the foot of the cross."
                  On the <date>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</date> of the same
                  year, I had the favour to be
                  received into the Congregation
                  which raised my drooping
                  spirits, &amp; increased my confidence in my faithful
                  Saviour:I began to think
                  I was owned by him, and
                  solemnly promised, through
                  His enabling grace to remain
                  faithful until death.
                  In <date>September 178</date>2, I was
                  permitted to partake of
                  the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. with the
                  Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for the first time
               </p>
         </div>
            
            <div type="page" n="7">

               <p>
                  which proved a real blessing
                  to me, &amp; for some time I remained in a cheerful frame
                  of mind. In <date>May 1782</date>,
                  I was received into the S<hi rend="superscript">r's</hi>
                  choir. In <date>June 1786</date>, I removed to the School, relying entirely upon our
                  Saviour for his support
                  &amp; grace to fulfill my duties
                  during the nine years I spent
                  ​​​​​​in that house, I enjoyed
                  many blessings in fellowship with the dear children, but had to experience
                  many trials &amp; difficulties
                  known only to God.
                  In the year <date>1795</date> I went

                  age &amp; <sic>encreasing</sic>  <corr>increasing</corr> infirmities
                  required my assistance.
                  This change of circumstances
                  was at the time, a severe
                  trial to me - but it proved
                  good for my soul. I had
                  to struggle with many 
                  difficulties, one of which
                  was bad health; but
                  tho' a sharp School, a
                  blessed one, for it taught
                  me to depend wholly on
                  my Heavenly Father -
                  who suffered not my con-
                  fidence to be put to shame.
                  In <date>1804</date> my dear Mother

                  departed this life happily,
                  and her frequent prayers
                  that the Lord would bless
                  me for my attentions to her,
                  have certainly been fulfulled;
                  Though for some years subsequent to her death, my
                  course was dark &amp; gloomy,
                  yet my faith in God was
                  unshaken.
                  In <date>1813</date>, I was married to
                  Mr. <persName>Samuel John Maud</persName>,
                  entering that important
                  state with prayer, and
                  full reliance on our Saviour's
                  help in every trial - which
                  indeed I experienced.

                  life happily, tho' from the nature
                  of his complaint, he was
                  seldom able to express his
                  sentiments. Thus I entered
                  a new state, while new &amp;
                  unforseen difficulties crowd-
                  ed upon me, &amp; had I not
                  known my Saviour, what
                  should I have done.

                  <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, to be choir labourer
                  of the widows; instead of
                  taking it simply out of
                  the Lord's hand, I yielded
                  to reason only, and could
                  not feel freedom to accept
                  it: by degrees however I found
                  I was wrong, knew that

                  our Saviour demanded it of me,
                  and therefore had to humble
                  myself before the Lord, and
                  entreat his pardon, but
                  my reasoning at time,
                  has often caused me sorrow
                  &amp; regret. Since that
                  period, the Lord has <del>been</del>
                  seen good to visit me
                  with many trials, some
                  quite unexpected, that in
                  my weak state, I feel rather
                  hard to bear - yet am sure
                  all has been for my good,
                  and that whatever comes
                  from <hi rend="underscore">his</hi> dear hand, how
                  hard it be, how strange
                  soever - I'll take it with a

                  passive heart, And tho' I cannot
                  shout for gladness, But
                  keenly feel afflictions dart

                  <p>Our late Sister was in the
                  habit of keeping a kind of
                  journal for many years.

                  gratitude to a merciful Saviour
                  that he has given that portion

                  in a most striking manner -
                  I do most firmly believe that
                  our Saviour will cause this
                  trying period to prove in the
                  end a wholesome affliction;
                  O may we all be purified
                  &amp; made meek for Eternity,
                  and may grace be still
                  continued to those who are
                  appointed to minister to us.-
