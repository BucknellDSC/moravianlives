               <p> About thne <date>1735</date> &amp; 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year of my Age I became at times <sic>trubilled</sic><corr>troubled</corr> &amp; uneasy by means of som Low

                     the end of Powell's memoir there is a passage about Small pox: "About this time the Gentlewoman I served sent her <sic>yong</sic><corr>young</corr> Daughter in my care to a
