                  I am born <date>1683 the 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Sept</date>. at <placeName>Kunewalde</placeName> in <placeName>Moravia</placeName>.
                  My Vater <persName>Dav. Shindler</persName> &amp; my Mother have been <del rend="strikethrough">concerd</del> concern'd about their Salvation, &amp; so they did whatever
                  they could to bring me up in a religious Way. In the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of my Age, I <sic>feeld</sic>
                  <corr>felt</corr> the first Labour of Grace in my Heart, but afterwarts afterwards went to divert myself w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the World, not without
                  restlessness &amp; Disatisfaction in my Heart. In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year of Age I <sic>marryed</sic>

                  <add>to be</add> confident towards my Redeemer, who very <sic>gratiously</sic>
                  <corr>graciously </corr>vouchsaved towards us. We soon get Intelligence of the great Awakening in <placeName>Teshen</placeName>, but as our Daughter made a Visit there,
                  She <note type="catchword">was betrayed</note>

                  was betrayed &amp; my Husband was for that put in Prison. However soon as he was set free again, he <del rend="strikethrough">did't [?]</del>
                  <del rend="strikethrough">[?]</del> could for all that not be silent by the Visit of Christ.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
                  <persName>David</persName> &amp; the following <hi rend="underline" n="red">great Awakening</hi> in this Country; and was by that means <hi rend="underline" n="red"
                     >imprisoned</hi> a <hi rend="underline" n="red">second time</hi>. I came in hard Circumstances for his Sake at last I got Bail &amp; he was set at Liberty again. Now
                  we seriously <sic>intented</sic>
                  <corr>intended</corr>
                  to leave our Mother-Country, because we had no rest &amp; to follow our B<hi rend="superscript">rrn</hi> which went before us. But as <sic>afterwarts</sic>
                  <corr>afterwards</corr>
                  <persName><hi rend="underline" n="red">Melchious Nitshman</hi></persName> with two <sic>familys</sic>
                  <corr>families</corr> more went away, such a wild Commotion ensued that we must in half a Hours time determine to leave our whole Habitation for our Souls Sake. I

                  <del rend="strikethrough">[?]</del> flung the key away &amp; went w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Husband &amp; three Daughters out the Door. Scarce had I left my

                  <corr>felt</corr> Rest &amp; Peace, that nothing in this World would have inticed me to return again. But <unclear>scarly</unclear> we had pursued our Journey some Miles,
                  we fell in with 8 young Men who brought us in the greatest Distress &amp; sevel times <sic>tyed</sic>
                  <corr>tied</corr> us. O in what <sic>Dificulty</sic>
                  <corr>Difficulty</corr> were we in! We <sic>knowed</sic>

                  <corr>immovable</corr> but at last they said, as we go for our Con- siences Sake they would let at Liberty. Who was more glad <sic>then</sic>

                  <corr>proceedeth</corr> our Journey w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a more firm Con_ fidence &amp; Faith. At <placeName>Schönbrunn</placeName>, where our dear
                     <persName>Brother de Seidliz</persName> had part of his Dominion, we heard the first <note type="catchword">Protestant Pr.</note>

                  Protestant Preaching en enjoy'd the Love &amp; Goodness of every Body. This we enjoyed every where, on our Journey till we at last save arrived at
                     <placeName>Bertholsdorf</placeName>. We went the same Day to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>, where they was just a building the Congregation House, the Brethren which
                  was on the Roof knowd us, came down, saluted us with great Joy &amp; Amazement that we escapd so happily. But as to the same Time was no Employment for us there,
                  then we lived 8 Weeks at <placeName>Bertholsdorf</placeName> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                  <persName>Vater Nitschmann</persName>, but afterwards the blessed Lady the <persName>Gersdorf</persName> took us under her Care &amp; pro- vided us a Lodging &amp;
                  Boarding at <placeName>Kemniz</placeName>. But as our dear Lady a Year after went to her Saviour, we beggd by our blessed Disciple for a Place in
                     <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>. We aquainted our Lord &amp; the Minister at <placeName>Kemniz</placeName> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Intention, But they
                  disuadeth us: saying what we would do in this <sic>Desart</sic>
                  <corr>Desert</corr>? &amp; who would give us there our Allimendation? My Husband <sic>answerd</sic>
                  <corr>answered</corr>: Our Saviour who nourished 4000 Men in the <sic>Desart</sic>
                  <corr>Desert</corr>, He hoped will find <sic>Advise</sic>
                  <corr>Advice</corr>
                  to bring us there through to. We moved also A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>
                  <date>1726</date>
                  to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>, where we found several Trials in the first Years, &amp; I found out very soon, that the bare Emigration from <add>my</add> Mother
                  Country, was not enough to set my Heart at Rest. The fundamental Him: not to belief on the Son of God &amp; his meritorious Wounds, was here laid open to me, so
                  that I did't venture to go to our Lords Supper &amp; thereby lost the great &amp; blessed <sic>Comunion</sic>
