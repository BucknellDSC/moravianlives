               <p>The Single Sister Mary Gladhill who happily 
                  departed this life Dec 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1809, has 
                  left the following few lines concerning 
                  herself. -- July 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1727. 
                  "I was born at Belly Bridge near Wyke 
                  and baptized in the Church of England 
                  from my earliest years I remember my 
                  Mother taking me to hear Mr Ingham 
                  preach, and I felt at that time, some  
                  thing of our Saviours nearness, which 
                  I however did not fully understand  
                  besides my natural inclination being 
                  after the world, -- In my 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 
                  year our whole family was afflicted 
                  with a bad fever, of which we all  
                  got better accept my Mother who 
                  dyed on it, we was now left in  
                  deplorable circumstances, I being the 
                  oldest of the Children; the towns 
                  people would give me no assistance,  
                  I had learned nothing to earn a lifely, 
                  hood, and was now obliged to go from  
                  door to door to beg my Bread, I  
                  met with many Kind Benefactors</p>

               <p>who pittied me in my distress; after 
                  sometime I went into service, from 
                  one place to another, I found it very 
                  hard and met with many troubles; having 
                  no body to tell my concern to, nor 
                  to care for me, I prayed to the 
                  Lord to help me, about this time 
                  I became aquanited with the Sisters 
                  Elizabeth and Sarah Holdsworth, and went 
                  to live with them; they often spoke 
                  to me about our Saviour, and I felt their  
                  concern and good wishes for me, but ^<hi rend="superscript">had</hi> no 
                  inclination to attend to it. I spent 
                  several years, in a very uneasy situation 
                  of mind, during this time I heart  
                  Mr Eastwood preach on that text 
                  of the ten Virgins, which had a par-  
                  ticular effect upon my heart, for it  
                  was clear to me I was in the Class 
                  of the foolish virgins, I wept before 
                  our Saviour and prayed him to have mercy 
                  upon me, and to forgive me all my 
                  sins, I felt on this occation some,  
                  thing which I can not express,</p>
                  
               <p>Our Saviour showed me his loving and  
                  forgiving heart, and I felt that he 
                  had suffered, bled and died for me. 
                  Being of an unsteady turn of mind I 
                  soon came into things again which was 
                  contrary to our Saviours will, an which 
                  account I spent many heavy hours 
                  but he always approved himself  
                  as my best friend, and took notice 
                  of me the poorest among the needy. 
                  <del>I felt now in our</del> <hi rend="superscript">Being now</hi> undetermined <del>state</del> 
                  whether to make application to belong 
                  to the Brns Congn or to be a follower 
                  of Mr Eastwood, I prayed to our Saviour  
                  to make it clear to me, which way to  
                  turn, and he convinced me the Brethren 
                  where the people to whom I should 
                  belong. Upon this I made application  
                  and obtained leave to come and 
                  live in the Sisters House at Gumersal, 
                  this favour was granted to me Oct 
                  10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760. for which I often thank 
                  our Saviour with my whole heart"

               <p>Our late Sister was soon at home amongst 
                  us, and thankful for her lot. -- 
                  Apr. 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1765 she was rec&#39;d into the 
                  Congregation and Apr. 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the following 
                  year, she partook for the first 
                  time of the Holy Communion. After living 
                  10 years in Gumersal she moved in 
                  1770 to Fulnek, into the Sisters House 
                  here, where she spent the remainder 
                  of her days, and tho she in that long 
                  period, met with many trials, both 
                  internal and external, yet her simple 
                  reliance and confidence in the Lord 
                  helped her thro in every case. -- 
                  She often used to say: "Our Saviour 
                  "and every body is very good to me 
                  "I can never be thankfull enough, 
                  "if I could only leave closer to  
                  "him, but he always tells me, I am 
                  "his, and He will keep me to the end." 
                  It can truly be said, Her happy lot 
                  to know our Saviour and herself and to  
                  live in the Congregation  was highly valued 
                  by her. She was contendt and chearful. </p>
                  
               <p>in poverty and thankful for every good 
                  gift imparted to her, and injoyed the 
                  the Love and good will of every one.--  
                  In general she was blessed with good  
                  health, even in her old age, which also  
                  was a matter of great thankfulness to  
                  her. About two weeks before her  
                  departure she was seriously attaked 
                  with sickness and vomiting, but she thought 
                  herself better again, and Nov. 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she  
                  injoyed the Holy Communion in fellowship 
                  with the Congregation, finding herself still 
                  very weak and her Cough growing trouble 
                  some, she submitted on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to  
                  go into the Sikroom, on Dec. 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> being 
                  asked in the morning. how she felt,  
                  she said; "Very well, I have no pain 
                  " and do not think I am going yet to  
                  "our Saviour, but if it be his will 
                  "to take me to himself, I am not  
                  "only resigned, but shall be happy 
                  "to be with him whom I love above
