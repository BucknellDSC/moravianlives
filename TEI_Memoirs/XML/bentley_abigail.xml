                     >d</hi> 1722 my Parrents was of the Church of England and brought me up in the
                  same, as far as I can remember my first thought of being fared was thro' hereing
                  my Mother speak with another what time Children begun to be anserable for Sin and
                  they thought at Seven-years, this had such an impression on my mind that I often
                  went alone and wish'd God wou'd let me die before that time for then I took it for
                  granted I should be saved, when I was about Seven Years I began to be afraid of
                  dying, my Parrents strove to preserve me as far as there circumstances permitted
                  them, in my Eleventh year I was sent to live with a Neighbour where I heard and
                  saw all sorts of bad things had not our dear Saviour had a perticular Hand over me
                  I should have been ruined in Soul and Body, when I was there they sent me into a
                  Feild to work where I was so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Fat nor could
                  I come to any House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that <hi

                     <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and
                  intended to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a
                  constant condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own

                  got any satisfaction in her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for her to go
                  and live with two or three Sisters who' was under the B<hi rend="superscript"
                     >rns</hi> care which she took very much to heart and could hardly be persuaded

                  self express &amp; it coud never bear to be Defard of the fellowship of living in
                  the midst of Sisters, and yet at the same she was in her heart very dry and her
                  being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very heavy for her to fell as
                  a Sinner depart alone upon our Saviour and this has been ameans of her course
                  being some what heavy in the Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some
                  time from place to place to place by the direction of the B<hi rend="superscript"

                  brought in to very great concern about her Salvation but as she was once coming
                  from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to her Heart, Out of pure grace
                  unmerited, Salvation show'rs on our Head Merely because the Lord had dy'd, Because
                  a Lamb was Crucify'd, Are we invited to possess a Throne, Before the World was
                  made ordaind our own, and she was from this time made sure of her Election * when
                  the Choir House was begun at Fulneck she with some others Out of the Oeconomys got

               <p>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro' looking so much at others
                  and being so very strict with her self she could not easily look over things that
                  some times accord amongst her compan -ions, yet at the same time we cannot denigh

                  was fully persuaded which show'd it self evedintly on various occasions, in the

                  it was made out that the said Oeconomy should be entirely broken up, and so she
                  with the rest of her Sisters came here into this House where she continued very

                  that she was now got to her right home, but thro' her very strict way of thinking
                  she brought her self into <del>many</del> great heavyness and deprivd her self of

                  that time and it was a great means of bringing her to a clearness again in her
                  Heart in the year 1763 complan ing much of a pain in her Head she was advisd to a
                  Cold Bath which removed the pain in her Head but soon after it was percived that
