               <p>The S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sus. S<del>h</del>mith who departed 
                  this life Dec 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1814 has left 
                  tho following short account concern 
                  ing herself: 
                  I was born at Morton Bank, in the  
                  parish of Bingley Jan. 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1746. 
                  Two days after my birth my Mother 
                  departed this life and I was put 
                  to my grandmother to be nursed. 
                  My father went to live for some- 
                  time in the S B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy at  
                  Smith house hear Wyke, and after 
                  a few years he moved to Fulneck 
                  where he was married the 3 time, 
                  on this occation he took me home 
                  again, being then in my 7th year.  
                  I often call to mind the blessings 
                  I then injoyed in attending the  
                  Childrens meetings, particularly once 
                  when Count Zinsendarf on our Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> 
                  day spoke to us much of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> 
                  love, and when the meeting was over 
                  came to ask each of us separate </p>

               <p>if we loved our Saviour which made  
                  a days impression on my heart. 
                  I my 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I came to live in  
                  the Srs house here, I entered with 
                  thankfulness, as I felt myself very 
                  unworthy of such a privile<del>d</del>ge, 
                  I found myself soon at home, lived 
                  for sometime very happy, and with 
                  the meetings I was greatly delighted.  
                  In externals it was difficult, nothing 
                  but spinning, however as long as I  
                  was satisfied, I did well; but when  
                  I deviated from the right path I  
                  grew unhappy and discontended, this 
                  brought me into trouble and dark- 
                  ness, reasoning and dispare, I wish'd 
                  to injoy privile<del>d</del>ges in the Congn 
                  but had to wait 7 years before I  
                  was recd Still my Saviour had 
                  thoughts of peace over me, and  
                  gave me grace to reflect on the  
                  past time, I felt and found that  
                  I had not been attentive to the  
               </p>
               <p>
                  voice of his holy Spirit, nor put my 
                  trust and confidence in him, this  
                  brought me into deep concern, I  
                  wept and prayed many nights and days 
                  that our Saviour would pardon my 
                  sins and transgressions, and receive 
                  me anew as his property, and I thank 
                  him this day, for his pardon, mercy 
                  and comfort which he then imparted 
                  to me. Nov. 13th 1768 I was recd 
                  into the Congn and Sept 8th 1772 
                  I had the favour to partake the first 
                  time of the H Comn which proved 
                  days of solid belssings to me, and  
                  I felt again happy and comfort- 
                  able, injoyed our Saviours nearness 
                  and the priviliges of the Congn 
                  proved a great refreshment and 
                  incouragement to my poor and needy 
                  soul. But alas! I soon again 
                  came into a dark and reasoning  
                  way, on which account I had many 
                  heavy hours, my uneasiness of mind </p>

               <p>was very great, I went to the H 
                  Comn often when I felt and knew 
                  it would have been better for me 
                  not to partake of this heavenly  
                  repast. Often I thought I would  
                  run away where I might be seen 
                  no more, and once I did set off 
                  and went to Mortenbank to a 
                  Relation, but feeling no rest there 
                  neither, I returned back again. 
                  I shall never forget the kindness 
                  then shown to me, of which I  
                  was so undeserving, but above all 
                  the mercy, love and forbearance of  
                  my Saviour, who still had not forsaken 
                  me; but kept his hand over me 
                  his erring Sheep. I stayed now 
                  from the H Comn for several  
                  times, the Lord had much to do  
                  for me, he pardoned my sins and  
                  washed them away in his precious 
                  Blood, and the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug 1780 
                  when I had the great favour again 
               </p>
               <p>
                  to draw near to the table of the Lord 
                  to partake of his Body and Blood  
                  in the Holy Sacrament, it proved 
                  to me an injoyment which I never 
                  shall forget. Now when I reflect 
                  on my ihequered course, I find 
                  thousand reasons to fall down at my 
                  Saviours feet, to thank and praise  
                  him for his unwearied faithfulness 
                  his patience and longsuffering, and 
                  tho I have often grieved him and  
                  disobeed the voice of his holy 
                  spirit; <hi rend="superscript">still</hi> he sought and found me  
                  when I strayed from him, and 
                  received me with open arms of mercy. 
                  "O thou my gesterday to day and ever 
                  "most faithful Saviour. I have 
                  nothing more to say, as Lord Jesus! 
                  I am a poor Sinner, who would fain 
                  thro' the Lambs ransom entrance gain." 
                  May he now prepare me for his  
                  heavenly Kingdom, where I shall  
                  praise him for ever, for what

               <p>he has done for me unworthy sinner 
                  here below. 
                  Thus far she dictated to a friend 
                  in Sept 1809. 
                  At that time she was in a very 
                  poor state of state of health, and 
                  thought that her time here below 
                  would not be long. However it  
                  pleased the Lord to restore her 
                  sofar that she could go about again 
                  tho in weakness and feeling many  
                  infirmities, whereby her faith 
                  and patience was often tried. 
                  As she has candidly stated herself  
                  the various scenes of trials in which  
                  <del>the</del> the Lord has helped her thro' 
                  we shall not innumerate any thing  
                  now; but unite our thanks and 
                  praises with hers, to him, who 
                  has had patience with her in 
                  time of need, and heard her prayers 
                  in the accepted time; who has done 
                  all things well, and now brought 
               </p>
               <p>
                  her to her desired haven. 
                  Within this last year she suffered 
                  much with pain and weakness.  
                  On Dec. 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she injoyed the H. 
                  Comn with 5 other Sisters in the  
                  Sickroom, she expressed herself after- 
                  wards very grateful, and said: 
                  "What I felt on this occation I shall 
                  "never forget, it was a foretaste 
                  "of Eternity, O Eternity! when shall 
                  "I once be there, with my dear Savr 
                  "surely, it cannot be very long. 
                  Tho she grew weaker, yet neither she 
                  nor we thought her departure <hi rend="underline">so</hi> near. 
                  On the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in a conversation, when 
                  amongst other things she was asked  
                  if any thing desturbed her mind, and 
                  if she felt quit resigned to our 
                  Saviours will? She replied: "I have 
                  "done with every thing. but you know 
                  "dying has always been an aweful

                  In the evening <hi rend="superscript">she was</hi> pretty easy but in 
                  the night she grew very restless 
                  and her breathing very difficult, 
                  and she prayed fervently to our  
                  Saviour to help her, in the mor
