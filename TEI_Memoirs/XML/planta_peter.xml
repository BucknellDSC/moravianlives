               <p>Memoir of the Life of our late venerable and happily departed Br Peter Jacob Planta, who entered into the joy of his Lord, at Ockbrook, May the 6th 1815, in teh 94th year of his age,
                  written by himself.</p>
               <p>I was born at Jonk√∂ping or town in Sweden, Dec. the 5th, old style in the year 1721. My Father's name was Jacob Planta &amp; my Mother's maiden name Martha Ruda. They were both of
                  the Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters, the [one] was born during my Mother's marriage to her first husband, whose name was Peter Shilling. Our Parents spared no pains in giving us
                  a religious &amp; genteel education; we had morning &amp; evening prayers in the family, to which the servants were also admitted. </p>
               <p>My dear Mother would often read in the bible, &amp; after prayers, read to me - take [] to us pleasing scritoral his- tories, especially such as had a reference to the life,
                  suffering &amp; death of our dear Lord &amp; Saviour, &amp; also his [connection] <note type="catchword">with</note>

               <p>with his disciples &amp; some of the [] time which the latter had to endure for his sake. On such occasions I used to sit on her lap, &amp; sometimes asked what reward the disciples
                  had for this faithful-ness to our Saviour, to which she replied: "They are richly rewarded for they are now exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly kingdom, singing his praises,
                  &amp; adoring him for ever." I said with tear, O my dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at the time our Saviour was upon earth, I also would have served him &amp; suffered for his
                  sake. My Mother replied weeping, "my dear child, if you had lived at that time you might perhaps have been of the number of those who cried out, crucify hiim! crucify him! " I said,
                  O no, I never would, but I should have loved him dearly. She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve me throughout my future life from
                  sin, &amp; the seductions of this evil world, until I should be with him in his heavenly kingdom, &amp; then added that all those who loved &amp; served him here, would share in the
                  same blessings which his disciples did. This made a deep impression on my mind, &amp; was the first time when I [] <note type="catchword">but</note>

               <p>but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp; attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour &amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I might become &amp; remain a true
                  child of God. When I was about 4 years of age, I experienced a remarkable preservation of my life. Having run out of the house [], with a spoon in my hand, I came to Lake Witter,
                  which was not far distant from our house, &amp; there being a broad plank laid over the water I got to the end of it, &amp; was sitting on it playing with the spoon, admiring the
                  drops which appeared to me like pearls. </p>
               <p>A woman who came to fetch water, called out to me to take care that I did not fall into the water, to whom I replied: I will not fall in, but she had scarcely returned to the house
                  before she thought that she heard a plunge in the water, upon which she set down her pail, &amp; ran towards the lake. Perceiving me in the water, she ventured in, &amp; with
                  difficulty caught hold of me by the hair of my head, &amp; drawing me out, she laid me across the plank, believing me to be dead. She then carried me home to my Parents, who, with
                  the whole family were <note type="catchword">greatly</note></p>
            </div>

               <pb n="4" facs="url" />
               <p>greatly alarmed, &amp; exceedingly distressed, as they could perceive no signs of life in me. I was however put into a warm bed, &amp; after some time, while they were lamenting over
                  me, I came to myself &amp; said dear Mamma don't cry for me. I am here, &amp; to the great joy of the whole family, I recovered. As I increased in years, I experienced several
                  preservations of my life, having been in danger of losing it, both by fire &amp; water, &amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents being desirous to give me a good education,
                  procured a private Tutor in the house, until I went to a large school, in which I continued till my Father's happyp depar-ture, which took place in my 10th year.</p>
               <p>My Mother's intention was that I should continue my studies, wishing me to be a Minister of the Gospel, which also accord-ed with my inclination. However a Relation persuaded my
                  Mother to put me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon &amp; Apothecary in Gothenburg. Here I had a favourable opportunity to learn Pharmacy &amp; chemistry, &amp; as my master had very
                  extensive practice, &amp; employed me to visit his patients, I gradually began to practice myself, &amp; gave considerable satisfaction to my employer. Having been awakened to a
                  sense of <note type="catchword">my</note>

               <p>my lost condition, I was for several years much concerned for my salvation, yea I may say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost carried on his work in my heart, by which I was
                  presented from many sinful things. I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning alternately, so that when I would do good, ever was present with me. I felt frequently a
                  great desire to separate myself from the world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour in which I took great delight. At such times I
                  felt much pleasure in singing praises &amp; thank<del>sgive</del>ing God; &amp; nothing afforded me greater joy, than to thank our Saviour for the many preservations I had
                  experienced from him, when in danger of my life. However I also, alas! often forgot myself, &amp; gave way to levity when playing with my companions. But the good spirit of God
                  frequently reminded me to seek the <hi rend="underscore">One thing needful</hi>. I felt strong desire to be a child of God, &amp; when I was invited with my Parents to
                  entertainments, at which was music &amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great uneasiness, &amp; like one who is sick, not understanding properly the accusations of my conscience. When I
                  was about 13 years of age I ahd a great desire to enjoy the Holy Com<add place="above">n</add>, for which preparing </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="6">

               <pb n="6" facs="url" />
               <p>I underwent an examination &amp; was encouraged to partake. The first time I had the favor to approach the table of the Lord, it was with fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive
                  it unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this divine repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst the Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart,
                  I frequently examined myself, fearing I was not yet a child of God, &amp; yet earnestly desiring to be one. Such was the state of my mind when I came to Gothenburg. I experienced, at
                  first much attention from the family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so long as I conformed to ever thing in it. How-ever the great concern I had for my salvation &amp; the
                  thought of not being a child of God, gave me much uneasiness. I was always glad whenever I could be alone, &amp; pour out the desire of my heart before God, &amp; frequently prayed
                  in stillness to him. I also resolved to withdraw from all worldly amusements &amp; to spend the little time I had to myself, in spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that I was
                  a child of God. Sometimes I arose in cold frosty nights, frustrating myself before God, &amp; praying most fer-vently unto him, but it afforded me no relief. I thought then that my
                  sorrow for my sins was not yet great <note type="catchword">enough</note></p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="7">

               <p>enough. I often repeated the 10 Command-ments, in order to see &amp; feel my deviations &amp; sins, but as I could not cry &amp; weep like David, who all the night made his bed to
                  swim, &amp; watered his couch with his tears, I thought my grief was not intense enough. But all my endeavours were in vain, because I [], in supposing that if I could but weep much
                  over my sins &amp; repent of them, then the Lord would receive me as his child, &amp; com-fort me. I was convinced of the all sufficing of our Lord &amp; Saviour's sufferings for
                  sinners, but thought I must be their qualified before I could receive this blessing. I became now very zealous, frequently reproving others for sin, &amp; my singular conduct brought
                  on me much persecution &amp; hatred, which however I gladly suffered, bearing all with patience &amp; never resenting any ill treatment, but on the contrary did such persons all the
                  service I could, &amp; whenever opportunities offered, spoke to them concerning our Saviour. Two persons in the family where I lodged being awakened to a sense of their lost
                  condition, one of them caused me much trouble &amp; uneasiness, on account of his fears &amp; unbelief, thinnking he could be not forgiven. He fell at last into a melancholy,
                  frequently hiding himself, <note type="catchword">and</note>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="page" n="8">

               <p>&amp; even attempted to take away his life so that he appeared in a state of mental derangement.</p>
               <p>I used my utmost endeavours to nurture him, fearing that in case he should commit suicide a great dishonor would be brought on the gospel.</p>
               <p>One time he sent me a message with <del>of</del> his last fare-well, having locked himself up with a view to self-destruction. This caused me unspeaka-ble distress, &amp; tho' I was
                  at that time en-ggaged in very urgent business &amp; in company with several persons, yet I took the key of the cellar, ran down &amp; locked the door, &amp; knelling down by a
                  hogshead of turpentine I wept &amp; prayed most fervently to our Saviour, (with great confidence), that he would preserve the poor man's life, &amp; it seemed to me as if I heard a
                  voice saying - Be comforted, no evil shall hurt him. This I believed, &amp; arose, giving thanks to God my Saviour, &amp; returned cheerful-ly to my business, till about 12 o'clock
                  at night, being [] in my mind, I [] some boards &amp; other things, when I found him alive &amp; feeling thankful to God for his preservation, I asked him why he had not performed
                     <add>executed</add> his intention, to which he replied, that when he was about to attempt it, he fell &amp; all his strength was taken from him, so that he could neither move a
                  limb, nor speak a word, till I came. I spoke comfortably to him, encouraging him to take his refuge to our Saviour, &amp; conducting him to his room, I prayed with him, &amp; in the
                  sequel he grew better. The other person <note type="catchword">who</note></p>

               <pb n="9" facs="url" />
               <p> who was awakened was the Cook, who died suddenly, but very happ<del>y</del>ily. She had been much beloved by her Mistress' Mother, &amp; her sudden death caused the old Lady to
                  swoon away. I was then, (altho I had been much despised &amp; derided on account of religion) called upon to speak comfort to the old lady, &amp; as soon as she recovered, she took
                  me by the hand &amp; begged my pardon, adding: "I have been the cause of the persecution you have suffered." I replied, "I have no occasion to forgive you, for you have done me more
                  good than harm, since it has caused me to [] [] my Saviour, who will hear the prayers of all repent-ing sinners. Thus her hatred &amp; persecution were turned into great love &amp;
                  kindness. About this time I attended the preaching of the Revd Mr Lindberg in Gothenburg. He observed in his sermon, that there were several kinds of people, who were hindered from
                  enjoying the happiness which the Lord would willingly bestow upon them, if they would but come in the way &amp; order of hi appointment. Among one of those sorts of well meaning
                  souls, I found myself so completely described as if I had opened my whole mind to him. He remarked that some people thought that if they could arrive at a certain degree of
                  ex-cessive grief &amp; anguish, &amp; could shed repenting tears night &amp; day, that then the Lord <note type="catchword">would</note>
