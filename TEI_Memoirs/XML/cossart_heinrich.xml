				<p>III. Our dear Brother <persName><hi rend="underline" n="red">Henry Friedr. Cossart</hi></persName>. As he did not write the full Account of his Life himself, then we only can
					aquaint the Congregation with the following, viz: I am born (he writes on a Place of himself) the <date>20<hi

					<corr><placeName>Frankfurt</placeName>
					</corr>on the <placeName>Oder</placeName>, where my Vater was Fencing Master by the <sic>Academie</sic>
					<corr>Academy</corr> but dyed <date>Anno 1715</date>. He was born at Raven in <placeName><sic>Normandie</sic></placeName>
					<placeName>Normandy</placeName> &amp; left <placeName>France</placeName> for the Sake of his Religion, he
					travelled to the <placeName><placeName>Isle of Jersey</placeName></placeName>

				<p>where he <sic>marryed</sic>
					<corr>married</corr> my Mother, who by French Parents was born in <placeName>England</placeName>. She died <add>1725</add> at Pomerswiz in <placeName>Silesie</placeName> by Baron de Frash. </p>
				<p> Soon in my tender years I feeld the work of Grace in my Heart, therefore I often wrote Letters to our Saviour &amp; bid my Mother to send it by the Post. I very often prayeth to
					dear God with many a Tears, to make me a Martyr, because I could nothing greater for me imagine, as to loose my Life for our Saviour. Anno <date>1730.</date> I came to Saxonia
					&amp; here I lost all the feeling of Grace <add>I had</add> in my poor Heart again; but for all that behaved like a Gentleman, &amp; in the <sic>Botom</sic>
					<corr>Bottom</corr> of my Heart believed nothing more at all. Anno <date>1734</date>. I got a Call of <persName>Sr. de Ziegler</persName> of <placeName>Renersdorf</placeName>. Here
					I studied with great eagerness the Languages, Philosophie &amp; especially Moral; <persName>Seneka</persName> was my Idol on whom I hung my very Heart, but this had its
					intercourses to, then the Love of the World conquered me very often. I frequently went to Strawalde to divert myself, but once Curiosity inticed me in <hi rend="strikethrough"
						>going hom</hi>e passing by to visit the Church in <placeName>Bertholsdorf</placeName>, where
						<persName>Magister Rothe</persName> just preached. The Gospel of the Cross of Christ soon conquered my Heart again &amp; I went <note type="catchword">to see</note>

				<p> to see <persName>M</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>r</persName></hi><persName>. Rothe</persName> at his own House, He recomanded me to <placeName>Herrnhuth</placeName> &amp; I came &amp; got Leave to abide there. So far his own Words.</p>
				<p> Some Weeks after his Arrival the Brethren sent him to <persName>Fr. de Shweiniz </persName>to instruct his two Lady Daughters (Our S.<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					<persName>Lorel Luedcke</persName> &amp; <persName>Lizel Marshall</persName>) which he did w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> all possible love &amp; according to his extraordinary
					Genius; Thereby he had a happy Time for his own Heart, but <sic>allways</sic>
					<corr>always</corr> was sorry that he was so soon taken away from the Care of the Congregation.</p>
				<p> A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>
					<date>1736</date>. He arrived at <placeName>Herrnhuth</placeName> again &amp; <date><date>1737 the 19th of

							><persName>r de Schachmann</persName> with whom he got a Call to <placeName>Berlin</placeName></hi>
					<date>1738</date> to the <orgName>Pilgrims Congregation</orgName>. The Month of <date>June</date> h. a. he was called to come to <placeName>Mborn.
					</placeName>&amp; there was <sic>marryed</sic>
					<corr>married</corr> to <persName>S</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>t</persName></hi><persName>. Taillard</persName> (as to his present Widow) he was blessed in this
					Marriage State w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 3 Sons &amp; 4 Daughters, which all are at several Places in the Congregation. Soon of his Marriage he travelled with his Wife to
						<placeName>Holland</placeName> where they receivd a Comission to visit the<placeName> Isle of Man</placeName> &amp; to deliver a Letter of the Disciple to the well- meaning Bishops there &amp; to make a more near <sic>Aquaintance</sic>
					<corr>Acquantaince</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Him &amp; as Well as to see if <note type="catchword">there</note>
				</p>
				<p>there is any Appearance of a Congregation, or at least some awakened Souls on that Island. They <sic>toock</sic>
					<corr>took</corr> their Route over <placeName>Holland</placeName> &amp; <placeName>London</placeName>, but
					our B<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. fell sick on his Way by a violent Fever at <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> where he was to stay for a Ship. The People there <sic>was</sic>
					<corr>were</corr> very kind towards him. Amongst the rest a Awakened Man who heard of him, came &amp; said: that he came to him, upon a <sic>Ordre</sic>
					<corr>Order</corr> of God to serve &amp; take Care upon him, but in the Place he must tell him to provide for his poor Soul, because of the Danger he was in. Our Brother very

					<corr>thankful</corr> for his Love, <sic>aquanted</sic>
					<corr>acquainted</corr> him, that in the Point of his Soul he was very [eassy] &amp; quiet, because <hi rend="strikethrough">he</hi> of his being <sic>aquainted</sic>
					<corr>acquianted</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. our Saviour &amp; can keep close to his Wounds &amp; by that means if he would take him from this World, he was sure he

					<corr>touched</corr> the Heart of this Man in such a Manner that he served him with the greatest Pleasure &amp; said: that he preceived, he was sent hither for his own best. Our
					Saviour took this Opportunity &amp; set the Heart of this Man towards his slaughtered Person &amp; not long after took him happy Home. As soon our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
					was a little better they set out for the <placeName>Isle of Man</placeName>, where the was very friendly received by the Bishop &amp; 6 Weeks entertained in the tenderest

				<p> A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date><date>1741</date></date>. He and his Wife set out for <placeName>Geneva</placeName> to the

					<corr>graciously</corr>
					<sic>aggreed</sic>
					<corr>agreed</corr>, but some <sic>Dificultys</sic>
					<corr>Difficulties</corr> arose by the Classe of Newshatel. At the End of this year he followed the Call with his Wife to <placeName>Montmirail</placeName> to take Care of the

				<p> Ao. 1744. By the Syrod at <placeName>Mborn</placeName> He &amp; his Wife were <sic>apointed</sic>

						<corr>Geneva</corr></placeName> She <sic>dyed</sic>

					the dark of Night over a shmal Bridge fell down a Story high on a whole Bank of Steep Rocks without any Damage. In the <date>Month of April</date> left

					<corr>Snow</corr>, never- theless there was a Watch kept of 40 Men at the very Top of the Mountain but out Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> caused it, that they saw neither him or

					<corr>Snow</corr> before our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> towards the <sic>Valleys</sic>
					<corr>Vallies</corr> &amp; recomanted them once more to the Mercy of our Saviour. On the other Side of the Mountain was again a French Watch, but went <sic>happely</sic>
					<corr>happily</corr> in a near Town where they kept a Marked; &amp; so our Br. <sic>luckely</sic>
					<corr>luckily</corr> passd the Simits &amp; arrived in <placeName>France</placeName> again. He witnesseth in <placeName>France</placeName> on several Places, but from

					<corr>thousand</corr> Dangers happily at <placeName>Montmirail</placeName> again.</p>
				<p> A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1745</date> he came from <placeName>Montmirail</placeName> to <placeName>Mariendorn</placeName> &amp; was there at the End of the Synod

				<p> heavy &amp; intricate Commissions (but necessary for the Safety of the Work of our Saviour) by the english Lords, who very often in the Begin grew impatient, but were cooled &amp;

					<corr>always</corr> attaineth the very Point of his Commission. That a <sic>usefull</sic>

					<corr>thankful</corr> for him, &amp; not to forget what our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> has done by the Hands of our dear Brother.</p>
				<p> In general we must of him: Nothing was <sic>to</sic>

					<corr>peculiar</corr> Disposition to help &amp; serve, &amp; the good Opinion he had <hi rend="strikethrough">by any</hi> of every Body, by whom he only could detect any Thing
					inclining to Good, insnared him very often in difficult Consequences. However if we <sic>loock</sic>
					<corr>look</corr> on the Basis on which his Actions were raised, we find indeed more reason to praise &amp; admire <sic>then</sic>
					<corr>than</corr> to charge this noble character with a Fault. A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1750</date> He <sic>get</sic> got <sic>a</sic>
