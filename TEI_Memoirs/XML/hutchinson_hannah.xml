               <p>The S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hannah Hutchinson, who departed
                  April 4th 1810 at Fulneck, was born at
                  Littemoor near Pudsey Nov. 22. 1784
                  From her childhood she attended with her
                  Mother and Sister the preachings here in Fulnec<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>
                  and by that means got a desire, to live in the 
                  B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> In July 1800 she obtained leave,
                  to become an inhabitant of the Sisters house
                  here Tho' she was of a reserved turn yet it
                  could be observed, that it was her concern both
                  to learn to know herself as a poor sinful being
                  and also the healing and sanctifying virtue
                  of Jesus' blood. In March 1803 she was rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                  into Congn and May the 4 followg into the S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                  S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir which oppertunities proved a blessing
                  to her heart, and an encouragement to devote
                  herself with soul and body to our Savour as his
                  Dear- bought property-</p>
                  <p>
                     In autumn the same year she was seized with
                  a bad fever, which brought her so low, that
                  she was not expected to recover again, nor did
                  she expect it hersalf, but was quite resigned
                  to our Saviours will; however the means used
                  for her recovery proved effectual thro' the
                  Lord's blessing. March 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1804 she</p>

               <p>
                  partook the first time of the H Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and 
                  rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> a special blessing on that occasion -
                  After this she spent 2 years in a happy and
                  comfortable way; but in the years 1806 meet
                  ing with troubles of various kinds she was
                  thereby much affected in soul and Body, and 
                  grew so poorly, that it was feared, she whold
                  fall into a decline; on which account
                  she went for some time to her Parents
                  house to be nursed. On this occasion like
                  wise our Saviour proved her kind Physician
                  both in Soul and Body, and she recover<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                  her health and chearfulness. She often
                  spoke of that period with many tears,
                  and would express herself to this effect:
                  Our Saviour alone knows, what I have
                  had to feel. Tho' I was sure, that I had
                  obtained pardoning grace in our Savior's
                  blood and that my sins and transgressions
                  were forgiven, yet it was as if I could find
                  no help, and being of a high Spirit and 
                  not willing to humble myself. I even re-
                 <cb/> 
                  solved in my mind to leave the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
                  But thanks, eternal thanks to him who
                  held his hand over me in all trials and
                  temptations, and proved my Counselor
                  and faithful friend. In January 1807
                  she was app<add place="above">o</add>inted a Teacher in our Board<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
                  School n<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, she served with faithfulness till
                  December 1809, and was beloved and re-
                  pected by the children commited to her 
                  care. Finding herselfe again in a poor
                  state of health, she asked permission
                  to leave the School, and went again to her
                  Parents Altho' she had a secret intimatio<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
                  that this sickness would terminate in 
                  her happy dissolution, yet now &amp;amp; then
                  she conceived a hope, that she would
                  recover. Some uneasiness which had oc-
                  curred sometime before, at first desturbed
                  her mind; but she was inabled to forget
                  the things behind &amp; obtained that comfort,
                  able assurance, that our Saviour had par,,

                  Her cough &amp; other complaints, which she
                  bore with petience, increasing more &amp; more,
                  she longed for the time of her desolution.
                  March 31 she injoyed the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for
                  the last time, which proved a great
                  blessing &amp; comfort to her; In Gratitute
                  for the tender care which her Parents
                  took of her, she prayed that our Savior
                  would richly bless &amp; comfort them.
                  Her last declarations concerning herself
                  are contained in that hymn: "Thy
                  thoughts of peace &amp; H B. N. 387.
                  which she also wished to be sung
                  at Her funeral. Apr 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Br Benade
                  at her request prayed once more with 
                  her during a blessed feeling of our

                  in the morning it pleased our Sa-
                  viour to call her into her eternal rest.
