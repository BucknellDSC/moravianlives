               <p>The Single Sister Martha Watson who departed  
                  this life June 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1810. was born July, 11. 
                  1743 in Pudsey and bap. in <hi rend="superscript">the</hi> Presbitirian 
                  Church. As a Child she came often errands 
                  to Fulnek and used to say she would like 
                  to live here, but her Father being not 
                  inclined towards the Brns Congregation she 
                  met with no incouragement, when she 
                  was 15 years her father departed this 
                  this life, and she was now obliged to go  
                  to service, she went to several places 
                  and at last to Hallifax, where she 
                  met with a very good Mrs, still 
                  it always dwell on her mind, and she 
                  felt a Call in her heart to the Brn 
                  Congn not being able to withstand 
                  it any longer she made application 
                  and March 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1772 she obtained 
                  leave to live in the Sisters House at  
                  Gumersal, she stayed here a little above 
                  a year, and was then removed to Ful 
                  nek and placed in the School Kitshen 
                  <del>as</del> to have management of it.--

               <p>the first line of the Holy Communion, Sake 
                  often used to relate that this period 
                  from her receiption till she had the 
                  favour to injoy the Holy Communion was the  
                  most remarkable in her life, it was 
                  the time when she learned to know 
                  herself, and as a poor undone Sinner 
                  found grace in our ^<hi rend="superscript">saviors</hi> sight.  
                  In the before mentioned sitiation she 
                  served 29 years with great faithful, 
                  ness on which account she was respected, 
                  she had many difficulties to struggle 
                  with, and had <hi rend="superscript">it </hi>very hard in the be 
                  ginning, but she looked to our Saviour 
                  for help, and often expressed her gratitude 
                  for what he had done for her. -- 
                  Being rather of a selfrighteous turn 
                  and not the best temper, it was at times 
                  troublesome for those who as here con 
                  nected with her, but knowing her 
                  intentions were good, every allowence 
                  were made. In 1802 she came to live 
                  in the Sisters House here, being troubled 
                  with the Rheumatism; and feeling her 
                  self not able to continue in her 
                  past, this was however <hi rend="superscript">a</hi> great trial 
                   
                  to her, being ased to an aitife life, she 
                  could not compass mind to have  
                  nothing to do besides she felt sich an atah 
                  ment to her School and the Children, that 
                  she hartly ever got over it, we had 
                  often to shear and comfort her on that  
                  account. The few years she spent in 
                  in our house she was way weak and  
                  infirm, in spring 1809 it appeared  
                  as if she was going in a decline, 
                  but she recovered a little again, and it 
                  terminatedin a dropsy, from since the 
                  beginning of this year she labored 
                  under much pain and sufferings, some 
                  times the time would appear long to 
                  her before our Saviour would realise 
                  her, but upon the whole she bore 
                  her pains with patience and regin 
                  resignation to our Saviours will, 
                  and prayed often to him to claanee her in 
                  his precious blood form every stain, 
                  that she may as a pardoned sinner 
                  appear him. This favour was granted 
                  to her June 21, when she happily 
                  fell asleep in Jesus. Aged nearly 67 years. </p>
