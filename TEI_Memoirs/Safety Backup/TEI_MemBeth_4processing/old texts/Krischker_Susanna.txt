VIII The Matrone <persname>Susan Krishker</persname>
The following is a Account of herself:
I am born <date>1712 the 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Sept</date>. at <placename>Hirsground</placename> in
<placename>Upper Silesie</placename>. I was but one Year old when my Vater
departed Life. In my 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of Age I was inticed <add>drawn</add>
at once in my Heart to go in a Corner & there to fall
down & pray to dear God, which I accordingly did. 
As soon my Mother & Sisters perceived my doing
so (because I did it often) they was very hard to me
because they was afeareth that I should become to
melancholy & may be quite <sic>Braincraked</sic>  <corr>Braincracked</corr>.
Therefore I seek for such <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr>, which could tell me
what I wanted & did't know myself. This was soon
                                                                bestowed

bestowed on me, then I came to <placename>Langendorf</placename> & found
some People which meet together, reading Books and talking
together about spiritual Matters. This I <sic>licked</sic>  <corr>liked</corr> very well
but for all that it would't do me Satisfaction.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1740</date> I came to <placename>Hillersdorf</placename> & heard there the first Time
of our dear Saviour, this touched my Heart, & from that time
I found no more Rest till I resolved to move to the
Congregation; but a soon my <add>Mother</add> get a Hint of this my
Resolution, she was very angry & sent me to her Sister,
which was very watchfull upon me. However our
Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> heard my continual Prayer & directed it also:
As B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & Sister <persname>Beutel</persname> pasd this Way, they <sic>promissed</sic>  <corr>promised</corr>
upon my Desire, to take me along & I soon was
ready and travelled w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> them & our Saviour guided
us save to <placename>Gnadenfry</placename>. O how <sic>thankfull</sic>  <corr>thankful</corr> was my
Heart that I at last found what I so long desireth.
Here I <sic>lernt</sic>  <corr>learned</corr> my Heart deeper to know, but by that,
I found the Heart of my Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> <sic>gratious</sic>  <corr>gracious</corr> &
full of Mercy, & that made me pour out many a 
Tears in his Heart. A. <date>44 the 24</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May</date> I was
a Pertaker of the holy Sacrament & the following
<date>November</date> I have been receivd w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a great Number
into the Congregation, As there was no Reception
a long While, a good many Breth.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & Sisters which
was gone since to our Lords Supper was among
them. A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>46 in the Month of July</date> I became
very sick, therefore they took me into the Choir House

for better to attent one. A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>57</date> I became Choir Disciple
which brought many a new Blessings about my Heart,
and from a much more intime Conversation arose
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my truest Friend I could in a very familiar
Way converse w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Saviour as one Friend w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Other.
So far She herself.
This Testimony we can give her: that She was a true
and <sic>faithfull</sic>  <corr>faithful</corr> Heart. The <date>11</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Febr</date>. She was taken
sick, as She came into the Sick Room She declared herself
also: God be blessed! now I'll lay down my Doings
& never think to grow well again, I'll employ my
Sabbath Days to the Interest of my Soul; & I can
be easy I have no <sic>Disatisfaction</sic>  <corr>Dissatisfaction</corr>, nothing against
nobody. She was a pleasant & happy sick
Person, her Heart delighted in his Passion &
sometimes talkd <add>conversd</add> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Saviour in the <add>so</add> tender
<unclear>intim</unclear> & <unclear>submisse</unclear> a <sic>Maner</sic>  <corr>Manner</corr>, that the other Sick
Sisters melted in Tears. As her Labourer came
to see & speak w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> her, She said: Our Saviour
was so very <sic>gratious</sic>  <corr>gracious</corr> to me in my Health &
now I am sick he made it so easy to me, 
that I scarcely feel the Pain <add>of</add> which other sick
Persons so much complain of. O there are
many Things for which I have my deasrest Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
1000 times to <sic>praisse</sic>  <corr>praise</corr>, & 1000 <sic>Thancks</sic>  <corr>Thanks</corr> are not
                                                                                         enough

enough for all what he has done on my poor
Soul. She repeated very often: O my dearest
Lord, nothing but thine Blood & <sic>Suffring</sic>  <corr>Suffering</corr> & Wounds
is it, which has taken & captivated my Heart:
and so it shall remain for ever.
This Morning the <date>23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi> She declard: how happy am I!
Myn Sabbaths Day is at Hand, the greatest Day
I ever knew. At Noon, her expected & happy
Hour struck at which the Blessing of her Choir
was bestowed on her, & so her Mouth grow pale
in her Soul went home to her Friend in
the 51<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Year of her Age.
