         <p>departed May 12, 1754Lewis William Thorn was born the 2<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> of febr. 1746: His Father who is at present in Wales in the
            Service of our Saviour: gave him in the Childrens Economy then at Buttermare in the month of March 1749, from whence he came with the rest of the Children to
            Yorkshire 5 Years ago. Before his Disorder, which began in the Month of March 1751, he was a very lively and brisk Child; had a tender Feeling
            of the wounded Person of our Saviour, and also such a very happy Turn of Mind, that
            his Brethren give him the Testimony, that they were able by one Word spoken in Love
            to manage him
            according to their whole Wish. In March 1751 He got a swelling in his Back, which after a while proved to be 2 great Holes, that
            grew worse evry Day notwithstanding all
            what B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Hurlock did with great Faithfulness to help the Case. The following sum, mer his
            Wounds began to smell so strong, that we were oblig'd to think of
            getting him separated from the other Children who were greatly troubled with it; but
            since we had in Smithouse no such Thing as a Sick Room, we thro' the Direction of
            Br Marshall
            found out B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> and S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Foulers, who took it upon themselves to nurse him for a weekly Payment
            <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">according</del> till we should be able more conveniently to do it ourselves. This Separation from
            the Children was a great Grief and Mortification to the little Heart, and
            not much less to us, who were only forced to comply with necessity. In these Circumstances
            he remain'd till we remov'd from Smithouse to
            Lambshill in May 1753, when we by order from our B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> in London as also according to our own
            Hearts and that obliga- 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p> tion we were under on his account took him home again; as much Pain as it did cost
            him the first time to part with us, so much Pain it now cost him to part with his
            Nurse, who had taken a tender Care of him to whom he was attach'd in an uncommon Manner, and whom he <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">suposted</del>supposed to be his natural Mother; <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">till</del> to lose this Object of [?] his affection made him for the first Week very melancholy and
            even sick; till he got again into the Company of his Children, and his Heart
            <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">met</del> got <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[unreadable] Object of Love</del>rid of this attachment by the Enjoyment of the Wounds of his so much beloved Saviour; then he was again quite in his Element, and never from
            that Time
            troubled any more about other things. Since last Christmas he had a particular Period
            of grace, and we felt constantly on him, that his Heart was nearly engaged with the
            Wounds of
            Jesus; he oftentimes on his own accord kept little Meetings for the Children in his
            Room, got them together in a Ring and sung verses with them, and then told them, what
            a tender
            Love our Saviour had for the Children, and how many Wounds and Bruises, he had got
            out of Love for them etc. At other times he got them together and prostrated with
            them at the Feet
            of our dear Saviour, and sung many delightful verses with them; this he did very often
            and always in such a priestly and Composed Way, attended with an exceeding great Nearness
            of
            the Lamb, that he gain'd all the other Childrens Love and respect in a particular
            Manner. A good while ago a Surgeon from LeedsM<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Lawman was here to see B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. Planta, who took him with Him in our House 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>to hear his opinion of our sick Children; when he saw our little departed Heart, he
            said, that several Bones would come out of the Wounds, which a little while after
            prov'd to be
            true; only they did not come interely entirely out, but remain'd in the Mouth of the
            Wounds, and stop'd <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">up</del> them <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[?]</del> up, that they could not be cleansed any
            more, which caused, that the Matter remain'd within and infected his inward Parts,
            without any body's body being able to help it: this caused him again to smell so strong,
            that no
            body could scarcely bear to be near him, and at the same time made himself and us
            all believe that he would soon go to our Saviour.
         </p>
         <p> The 4<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May after the Childrens Meeting B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. Petersen had all the little Children round
            about him, and spoke with them about their Hearts' Connexion Connection with our Saviour;
            and at once there was such an emphatical Presence of our Saviour amongst them, that
            evry one
            of them wept heartily, and told Br. Petersen, how happy and melted they felt their
            Hearts; and among the rest our little Lewis William was so affected, that he
            could not give over weeping for a long while; and afterwards complain'd to the Chil,
            dren that he was not yet baptized, and wish'd so heartily, that he might soon partake
            of that
            great Happiness.
         </p>
         <p> The 5<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May I went to him and spoke with him, asking him, if he knew that he was not yet baptized;
            he said, he knew it very well, but
            long'd very heartily to be baptized; I ask'd him, when he should like it. He said:
            O this very day. I then told him
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>(for it was already made out with the Brethren) that this grace should be bestowed
            upon him this very Evening; O how glad was he, and said to Br. Petersen, but do you
            know I shall be
            baptized this Evening? O yes. I shall: then said Br. Petersen to him; but dear Billy? tell me in what Manner will you come to our Saviour?
            He said: as <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[?]</del>Mary Magdalen, who wept over his Feet, and kiss'd them and wip'd them with the Hairs of her Head;
            and as he said this, the Tears rolld all the while down his
            Cheeks, and they sung together: we are thy Children small and mean who in ourselves
            are nought but Sin, but his Wounds Roses Fragrancy perfum'd us to a sanctuary. In
            the Singing Hour
            that same Evening after being dressed in a proper Manner according to his weak Dis,
            position <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and</del> he was brought into the Hall, and there in an inexpressible happy Manner
            overstream'd with the Blood and Water out of Jesus side, and call'd Lewis William: What there was felt at this opportunity I leave to the Hearts of all the
            Brethren and Sisters that were present: and so he went happily to Bed and slept all
            Night like an Angel: in the Morning we ask'd him, how it had been in his Heart at
            his Baptism, he
            said: O I can't express it, how warm and sweet it was to me.
         </p>
         <p> The following whole Week he grew weaker and weaker, and if we ask'd him if he had
            much Pain? he said, no, none. but I said: dear Heart does your Breast not hurt you?
            no, Said he:
            and so he laid like a Lamb all the while and smiled some
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p> for himself, and if we ask'd him, what he thought about? he said: I think of our
            Saviour and his Wounds, and will soon go to kiss his Feet; and he said further: all
            my Play things
            divide among the other Children; and then he said to Petersen: this is my Favourite Verse: Thus reclining always twining etc. The 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May in the Evening about 10 o Clock I went to see him and saw it
            drew nearer towards his Departure: I ask'd him, if he then intended soon to leave
            us? yes he said very soon: for I go soon to my Saviour? but I said: dear Heart, tell
            me what will
            you do as soon as you come there? He said: I will run di, rectly to kiss his thro'
            bored Feet; but I said, will you then do the same in our Name? He said: O yes I will;
            then we sang
            him some verses and went <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">al</del> to Bed: near 1 o' Clock we were call'd up again, and then he was going , we sung
            him: The Lamb with all his Grief and Smart etc. Pale Lips!
            kiss him upon the Heart! open Arms take him. during which last Words he fell sweetly
            and happily asleep in the Arms of his so beloved Bridegroom with this Watchword of
            the Day: Get up, my beloved and beautiful one, and come to me! Here I am, my Lord and God,
            instruct me.
         </p>
         <p> The happy Departure of this little Heart is for several Reasons of a very agreeable
            Nature; for he would never in his Life got his Health rightly again any more; and
            2<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">dly</sup>, he was quite ripe for it, as to his Connection with the Saviour; He is now out of all Danger and rests in Peace; and the several
