         <p> Life of the married Sister Johannah Eleonora Benade, who departed this life at LondonJanuary 7<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1792 She has left the following written Account measuring her course thro this life. I was born October 22<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> 1756 at Eubau (Iboro) in Upper Lusatia &amp; baptized the 26<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> in the Lutheran Church. My dear Parents, who led a pious life, and as members of
            the Brethren's Society visited diligently at
            Herrnhut, dedicated me to the Lord from my birth, and en- deavored to educate me as well as
            the rest of their Children only for Him. They were very careful
            to preserve us from bad Company; for which reason our faither instructed us him- self
            in reading, writing and cyphering - In my early infancy the holy Ghost evidenced his
            labor upon
            my heart. I still remember, when I was but 4 Years old, that seeing my mother pray
            to our Saviour, and hearing how she thanked Him for his blithe sufferings, I kneeled
            down by her
            and wept aloud - In my 7<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year my Parents took me frequently to Herrnhut, where I had opportunity to visit the Children in the
            Oeconomy and was greatly delighted, when they taught me 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>[?]erses and times; yea, I left them always with reluctance, when my parents returned
            home, and begged my Father, to let me stay with such happy Children, who told me so
            much of our
            Savior. He replied: if I would entreat our Savior for it, he would certainly hear
            me, which I did in good earnest. About this time I got the small pox, and nobody expected
            I should
            recover; however, in a short time I was restored. But having had a small pox in the
            eye, it made my eye sore for a whole year, &amp; I was in great danger of losing it; at
            length
            however it was happily cured. In my 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year my dear mother being delivered of her 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Child, died in consequence of it. In
            her last illness she gave us still many good admonitions, and on the last day of her
            life, having desired her 4 Children, that were still living, to come to her bed_ side,
            she
            entreated every one of us in the most affecting manner, to surrender our whole heart
            to our Savior, and not to forsake him all the days of our life, to do all we did in
            his name, and
            to bring all our concerns, great &amp; small, in prayer before Him; thus we all shou'd fare well. Her happy departure made a deep impression upon us and upon all,
            that were present Weak as she was, she would be helped out of bed, 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>in order to render upon her knees cordial tha[?] to our Savior for all the mercy &amp;
            faithfulness, she had experienced from Him &amp; to recommend her Children unto Him for
            the
            last time in this vale of tears. Soon after she departed hap_ pily as a reconciled
            Sinner ~ My oldest Sister - S.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>Rose in Labrador - undertook to act mother's part towards me &amp; my youngest Brother and bestowed much
            care &amp; faithfulness upon
            us, for which may our Savior reward her abundantly. At Whitesentide in 1764 my father took me again to Herrnhut on a visit;
            and being brought to the Girls' Oeconomy, I entreated S.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>Benigna von Watteville - now Bruiningk - to receive me now as an Inhabitant into the house, because my desire was to become
            a happy Child,
            and had often prayed our Savior with tears, to grant me this favor. She gave me an
            opportunity, to address the Brethren of the Directory, just then met in Conference,
            telling them my
            request in all Simplicity; upon which they took it immediately into consideration,
            &amp; to my inexpressible joy my petition was granted. June 12<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>
            1764 I moved into the Girls' Oeconomy, where I spent the remainder of my Childhood happy
            &amp; cheerful and with an abiding blessing for all the days of my life. There was
            in general 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>[??]r that time a blessed Course among the Child_ ren and I can never think of it
            without particular gratitude both to our Savior &amp; to my father, who regarded no expence
            expense
            to have me secured from the Seduction of the world. By degrees I came into a very
            familiar intercourse with the Friend of Children, &amp; I scarcely closed a day without
            begging our
            Savior's pardon for all that might have grieved him in the course of the day. On our
            festival the 17<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Aug. 1767 I
            received such an extraordinary impression of our Savior's great love towards me, that
            my heart was melted into tears, &amp; it was to me, as though I had really beheld our
            Savior
            on the corss. Another time the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> being met for the Lord's Supper, I heartily intreated our Savior, to give me a share
            of the blessing, which the adult B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> were now enjoying - for I
            had a very high notion of the Lord's Supper, having seen that my parents, whenever
            they went to it, were particularly af_ fected and in that hour our Saviour appeared
            to the eyes
            of my Spirit, as having a little Child upon his arms and blessing it, which filled
            my heart with joy. March 25<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1769 I was received among
            the great Girls, on which occasion I surrendered myself anew to our Savior, recommending
            
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>my future course to Him &amp; His holy Spirit with particular concern, because I knew
            very well that my happy Childhood, in which I had not felt much of misery &amp; sinfulness,
            was
            now past. But still I went on in my childlike course for a whole Year, &amp; was received
            into the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>July 2<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> 1769. But now I learned in the School of the holy Ghost gradually to discover the wretchedness &amp;
            corruption of human nature. Being still under the same faithful care as formerly and
            not exposed to see or to hear any thing bad, I could not comprehend at first why I
            could no
            longer look upon things with the same simplicity, and converse with our Savior with
            the same childlike confidence as formerly; and seeing my Companions cheerful, I imagined
            that I
            alone was such an unhappy Creature, and wept day &amp; night over my sinfulness. But our
            Savior granted me the spirit of uprightness, that I could speak with my Laboress about
            every
            wrong idea who made it plain to me that this was a period of grace and of the blessed
            Labor of the holy Ghost; which greatly strengthened my confidence to our Savior. I
            was also
            richly comforted by him and recovered my former cheerfulness. 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>Meanwhile my Father was married a second time and Gnadau being fixed upon as his future place of abode: it was thought proper, that he should
            take his Children
            with him, both for his assistance &amp; for their further education. March 17<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1770 we arrived in Gnadau. This place
            was then in its first beginning; not only the outward Subsistance was difficult, but
            there was also a want of spiritual encouragement, which made me regret
            Herrnhut very much &amp; occasioned some remissness in my course. But when the first 6 single
            Sisters arrived at Gnadau &amp; with
            them a Laboress of a motherly heart, who took particular care of me: I experienced
            a blessed revival and March 20<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1771 I was admitted to
            the h. Com.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> which proved a great blessing to me. In November 1772 my dearly beloved Father departed
            happily in the 68<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Year of his Age. I attended him much in his last illness. His hearty and childlike
            prayers to our Savior, when he imagined to be
            alone, his anointed conversation about the bitter Sufferings and death of Jesus and
            even his talk when absent in his mind, testifying that his heart was full of this
            matter, left
            
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>a blessed impression upon my heart. After his departure I fell upon my knees &amp; entreated
            our Savior, to take me as a f[???] Orphan under his special Care and to enably me
            by his
            grace to follow the steps of my Father. I now moved into the Sisters house, where
            we labored under great diss[???] outwardly, having frequently no work; but the inward
            [????] was
            truly pleasing and I can remember, that frequently a posti_ [???] emotion took place,
            when but a few [???] were singing for an [????] blessing. In 1774 I was received
            among the single Sisters, and on that day remembered my Covenant with our Savior,
            thanking him at the Same time for all the mercy &amp; faithfulness I had [???????] hitherto.
            In
            1776 I came to him at Barby, where I could make a comfortable [???]hood, which I looked upon as a gracious answer
            to my Prayer, which I had
            often [???] up to our Savior in my needy [????????]. But it was also a blessed time
            for my heart. The holy Ghost led me farther into the [????] knowledge of my_ self
            &amp; gave [???]
            to see my [????] &amp; sinfulness in the true light. How did [??] suffer me to [???] and
            to [????] [????], but filled my heart with inexpressible comfort and [???] 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>It was now my chief concern, to have a full enjoyment of the maritorious life, sufferings
            and death of our Savior and to apply his merits to my individual Case. In process
            of time I
            conceived a doubt, whether I had really experienced the new birth of the heart, and
            I would often by weeping and praying extort, as it were, some ocular demonstration
            of it; but our
            Savior's will was, I shou'd believe, without seeing. Some time after it happened at the holy Communion, at the
            pronouncing of those Words: This is my body, which is given for You, that they entered like a dart into my Soul, as if somebody said: yes, for thee,
            out of love to thee he has given himself into death.
            Than it was, that my heart was melted like wax at the fire, the eyes run with tears
            of love and gratitude, yea I thought, I could <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">lik</del> lie for hours together at his feet
            weeping grateful tears. The majesty and greatness of God our Savior on one hand and
            my poverty and unworthiness on the other were set before me in such a contrast, that
            I appeared
            unto myself as the most insignificant Creature and yet I had such a full assurance
            of his having given himself into death for me, that I was abund_ 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>antly comforted, &amp; from that time no more desired my ocular demonstration. I went
            on for a considerable time in the blessed form of mind, and took a daily hour to [????]
            with our
            Savior about all my [???]. As long as I faithfully kept to it, and suffered no business
            to in[???], I continued in a happy [???] and no coldness took place between Him &amp;
            me yea
            our Savior frequently granted me such unexpected visitations of grace, that I [???]
            not have taken the whole world in [????] for my happiness. How a desire was raised
            in my Soul: Oh
            that I could testify my love and gratitude to my good Lord! Oh that I could s[???]
            him in the heart for All he has done to me! &amp; at times my heart was so burning with
            love, that
            I thought I would not regard my own life, but sacrifice it willingly for our Savior.
            However I did not as yet discover this desire of my heart; but soon after I was appointed
            house
            Servant in the Sister's Choir, which was an agreeable employment to me. I likewise
            served 7 Years as Hall Servant with muc pleasure. In 17[?]2 I was desired, to begin
            a School
            with [?] Children, for which I felt no great [???]_ nation at first, being well aware,
            that it is 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>a difficult and important Charge, requiring much patience and wisom, to act towards
            the Children in such a manner, as to give them no offense, but rather prove a blessing to them. Self-love also suggested the thought: hitherto
            thou couldst go on unobservedly, but now thou wilt be exposed to the
            criticisms of others. However I was heartily ashamed of it &amp; thought: what a poor
            Creature am I? I vowed, to sacrifice my life for our Savior, and now, when it comes
            to the
            point, I raise objections. Thus then I accepted the proposal with an obedient and
            willing mind, and can say with truth, that this employment has proved a great blessing
            to my own
            heart. Our Savior has numberless times blessed me for the Children's sake, and at
            the same time I had an opportunity to improve in self-knowledge. Whener my heart was
            not clear
            &amp; cheerful, Schooling became bothersome to me and I was necessitated to beg for new
            grace. Likewise my endeavors about the Children frequently led me to think, how much
            trouble
            our Savior had with me, to keep me in the right way. Of that time there is still one
            day worthy 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>be remember'd by me as a distinguished day of blessing. I mean the 4<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May, when it was 50 Years since the single Sisters
            had made this first Covenant. When we kept the Lord's Supper at the close of the day,
            and I renewed that Covenant with our Savior, which I had made so often with him, to
            seek for
            nothing in the world, but how I might be His with soul &amp; body, with an earnest desire,
            that each drop of blood might be devoted to Him; I felt the peace of God in such a
            manner,
            that I was fully assured, He himself had seated this Covenant and that nothing should
            pluck me from his hands. In this blessed hour I desired to depart and to be with Christ,
            lest I
            should be disturbed again in this happiness. God be praised for all the grace, He
            has bestowed upon me while in the single Sisters Choir. Admidst all my wants &amp; failings,
            which
            bowed me in the dust and made me appear as a great Sinner before Him, I could hartily
            rejoice over my lot of grace, and had no other wish, than to continue in this course
            all my
            life. In 1786 the marriage to my present husband was proposed to me, and having duly consider'd
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>this great and important change, and being convinced, that it was according to the
            gracious will of God, I gave my consent to it. Relative to my course in this Choir
            I have thousand
            reasons to thank our Savior for having given me such a guide through life, who under
            all circumstances and amidst many failings and infirmities has borne me with great
            love and patience, &amp; has endeavored to promot the welfare of my Soul as well as he
            could. In the first Year of our marriage a little Son was born to us, whom our Savior
            took to
            himself when a Year old. We had to go thro' a variety of difficult circumstances, partly inseparable from our Service and partly
            occasioned by heavy sicknesses; but
            our Savior has supported us graciously and never left us without comfort. On my part
            I have nothing to boast of, but rather to be ashamed and to weep tears of contition[?]
            at his
            pierced feet, for having been so little an honor to Him, in return for what He has
            done for and upon me, &amp; for having come so short of what I ought to have been. Many
            a time the
            Spirit was willing but the flesh was weak. 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>How our good Lord, who has been my light and stay throughout my whole life, will not
            leave me now forsake me till my dissolution, and when it finally comes to that issue:
            That I draw
            my latest breath, And that Soul and body sever Them the slaughter'd Lamb &amp; display'd for me I shall see. So far her own Narrative. In her last
            illness she desired expressly, that the follow declaration might be added to her written
            account: The holy Ghost at the end of my life has led me into a School of a very trying
            nature, but although I had a much clearer view of my failings and infirmities than
            ever be- fore, my heart nevertheless was more disposed to meditate on the blessed
            leading of my
            dear Savior and to praise &amp; adore Him for all the love and mercy bestowed upon me,
            than to weep and mourn over faults &amp; misdemeanors, which He has pardoned". Now her
            late husband, the present Widower contains in the Narrative: The Seven Years of our
            married State, were, as it was, a connected CHain of difficult 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>circumstances and trials of our faith, and in all this our wise Leader seemed to have
            the perfecting of our late Sister for her eternal rest principally in view. But a
            few days and
            nights of hers during this period were free from pain &amp; affliction, and every rising
            hope was soon blasted again. At times she appeared to herself as appointed for trouble
            and I
            myself was inclined to think the same. But the Lord was with her in all her tribulations
            and his comforts refreshed her Soul daily and richly, so that she could sometimes
            forget her
            misery entirely and heartily rejoice in God her Savior. Her greatest distress was
            that her continual ailments prevented her attending her office in the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> agreeably to her wishes. She did however what she could according to the gift and
            grace imported to her, and it was of great comfort for her
            to enjoy ev'ry where the love of the Brethren and SIsters. After having served the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> at
            Neusaly 4 Years and the Cong.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> at Gnadenfrey one Year during the Synod, we were
            called to London, where we arrived June 5<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1790. Having always lived in the Country, she found it very difficult to
            accustom herself 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>to such a change of life and climate, and an account of the poor State of her health
            she found it no easy task to learn a new language in short this proved a new trial
            to her in all
            respects. But she looked up to Him, who remembers his Servants and handmaids in affliction,
            who has numbered all their days and noted them down in his book; and whenever it appeared
            to her as if she was entirely useless, she pos- sessed her Soul in patience and looked
            forward to the time, when she hoped to be Serviceable and active. Meanwhile the Cough
            she had
            had before, increased and she fell into a gradual decline. We made two short trials,
            whether she might be helped by a change of air, which did not answer our expectations,
            and when
            we were about making a third trial, a fit of illness, which seized myself, prevented
            it entirely. Many a time we both have taken the recove- ry of her health, as an important
            matter
            for us, into our most Serious consideration, and not knowing what to do, we have recommended
            it to our Savior jointly in fervent prayer &amp; with many tears; which being answered
            by
            a most comfortable experience of the peace of God, we could take all the

         <p>her for the glory of the world to come. The holy Ghost discovered unto her all the
            remaining traces of her natural depravity and wrought such a Poverty of spirit in
            her, that she
            gladly forgot all her good work and even wondered, how the B.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>
            could show so much love and kindness to her; for which she was heartily thankful.
            The merits of Jesus Christ were exceedingly precious to her and his bitter sufferings
            afforded her
            much com- fort in her pains. She would often say: oh! &amp; how deplorable would now be
            my condition, if I had not a Savior, if I cou'd not believe in Him and lay hold on
            his
            precious promises. God be praised! He has forgiven me all my Sins, and washed them
            away <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">by</del>with his precious blood; I have no righteousness of my own to trust in; but I know, that
            He loveth me, &amp; that He will not cast me out, when I come to him; I am his
            blood-bought property. As we were once speaking together about a certain class of
            people, who treat their Salvation but superficially, and rather will excuse than bemoan
            their fault,
            she said: I thank our Savior, that He has never suffered me, to be careless or indifferent
            about my Salvation, but has enabled me thro' grace, 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>to look upon it at all times as a most serious &amp; important affair, and to make my
            calling and diction sure. Now I reap the benefits from it, and can heartily rejoice,
            that the
            grace of our Savior has not been frustrated by me. A b[???] hope of eternal life and
            of the glory, which is to be recreated, was an in[?]stionable jewel to her, and the
            joyful
            prospect, to be soon at home with the Lord, and to see her Redeemer face to face,
            made her often forget her pains &amp; afflictions. She therefore frequently desired, to
            have such
            texts of scripture, and those fine hymns, which treat of this matter, read to her,
            and I could do her no greater pleasure, than by conversing with her about it. She
            would often
            anticipate the joy, to meet so many friends &amp; acquaintances, who had departed to our
            Savior before her and to see others follow<del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ing</del> her. In this point of vien[?] she
            was heartily thankful, that our Savior had taken our little Son to himself &amp; also
            herein acknowledged the love &amp; wisdom of provi- dence. For the rest she declared Several
            times, that she was entirely delivered from every attachment to the things of this
            life, &amp; that she knew of no impediment, to depart

         <p>and be with Christ the former the better; but me with less took care, to settle all
            her matters &amp; to care for me to the very last day. Having gone thro' so much
            sickness [????], she [???] shot her last illness wou'd be so much the shorter. But
            this not being the case, she was at times very much distressed, y[??] above[?] it
            in [?????]
            about it. However she departed[??] to our Savior in prayer and begged me some- times
            to pray in fellowship with her, whereby she was remarkably refreshed &amp; comforted.
            She
            resigned herself from time to time into the will of the Lord &amp; only intocated[?] Him,
            to write g[???] her pains and to grant her the [????] patience, which he also did
            in mercy.
            Some- times she would beg for aword of comfort suitable to her circumstances, and
            when she opened the Text - or Hymnbook, she would get such striking and suitable [???]
            that she was
            filled with joy. Her illness having much resemblance to that of the late Sister Louise von Hayer, she desired to have her life and particularly the latter part
            read to her several times and desired also [???] [???] much comfort, rejoicing in
            the [???] [???] [???] whenever she reacted a [???] [???] of her illness.

         <p>She loved to be visited by the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup>, but was too weak for a long conversation. All disagreeable things, that had
            occurred, she could lay aside and rejoice that she was at peace with every boy, and
            that she would soon come to that perfected Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>, where all is peace
            and harmony. Many of those, that came to see her, were edified by her meekness and
            patience and declared, that the peace of God, which (??) her heart, was to be seen
            inher

         <p>The nature of her illness (??) much attendance, she was frequently concerned, lest
            she should at length tire out our patience. But so much the more thankful was she,
            that the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> were willint to assist, whenever it was wanted, &amp; prayed our Savior, to reward them
            richly for all their
            kindness. She also remember'd with particular gratitude the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> Lowder &amp; Hurlock for their unremitting attendance in the medical line.
         </p>
         <p>Her last birthday she celebrated with much cheerfulness, and grateful remembrance
            of past benefits and blessings &amp; her last participation of the Lord's Supper was attended
            with a
            foretaste of heavenly joy.

         <p> At length the long wish'd for hour of her happy dissolution arrived when his sufferings
            seemed to have risen to the highest degree.
         </p>
         <p>Some days before, after having once in the middle of the night prayed most affectingly
            to our Savior, she said: now the time of my departure is at hand, he himself has given
            me a
            most comfortable assurance of it. From that time her patience under increasing Sufferings
            was truly admirable, so that Sometimes I was inclined to think she was without any
            pains,
            whilst actually according to her own expression, life and death were struggling within
            her.
         </p>
         <p>She wou'd often say: I experience indeed, what it is to die: God be praised that I
            have only the pains and not the fear of death, &amp; that amidst all this I can rejoice
            that the
            end of my natural life will be the end of all my misery and the beginning of eternal
            joy.
         </p>
         <p>The 7th of January (1792) being the day of her departure, in the morning she took
            our Servant by the hand &amp; said: Nanny pray for me, to day I shall go to our Savior.
            After dinner
            she desired me to stay with her and not to leave her on any account, and soon after
            the last conflict began, tho' not attended with any strong convulsions or disagreeable
            fits. She
            had many 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p>times expressed a wish, that she might not be a dishonor to our Savior by unbelief
            &amp; impatience in her last hours, but that she might deport herself as a Child of God
            to the very
            last. This grace was granted unto her and her latter end was truly edifying. She retain'd
            her presence of mind to the last hour, folding her feeble hands and praying without
            ceasing;
            she also begged of us, that were present, to continue singing and praying; &amp; when
            I gave her the last blessing for her departure, she was much affected. I asked her
            once more:
            whether she desired any thing? she replied: no, nothing but my release. And this happy
            release from all distress &amp; woe she obtained at 9 o'Clock in the evening, when she
            fell
            gently asleep. Now she rests in the arms of eternal love, refreshing herself at the
            very fountain head of all comfort and joyfully waiting for the blessed time, when
            her vile body
            now committed to the dust, shall be raised in corruptible &amp; fashioned like unto the
            glorious body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Her Age was 35 <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">days</del>years, 2 months &amp; 7 days.
