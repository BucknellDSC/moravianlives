Title: Memoir of the life of the married Sister Anna Louisa
Eleonora Foster, maiden name Latrobe - who departed
July 27th 1824 at Bedford, in the 63rd year of her age.

Our late S<sup>r</sup> not having left any written Memoir of her own
life, the following has been compiled partly from Memoran-
dums, furnished by her surviving husband & her children,
& partly from Extracts of her very extensive & interesting cor-
respondence with some of her children & other friends.
<indent/>She was the eldest daughter of our late highly respected B<sup>r</sup> &
[S<sup>r</sup>r ??] Benjamin Latrobe, & was born Nov<sup>br</sup> 3<sup>rd</sup> 1761 at Fulnec where
her parents were at that time labourers of the Cong<sup>n</sup>, & by whom
she was devoted at her birth, so that Saviour who created and
redeemed her. She was baptized by her late dear father into the
death of Jesus. At an early age her parents placed her in the
Institution for the Education of the children of the Ministers of the
B<sup>rns</sup> church in that Settlement. When about 8 years of age, her
father was called to be Provincial Helper of the Engl. Cong<sup>ns</sup>, & removed
to London; in consequence of which she was deprived of enjoying the im-
mediate constant care & tuition of her parents. She was from her earliest
years of a serious reflecting turn of mind, & soon showed talents far
above her years. She especially took great pleasure in reading & medita-
ting upon the word of God, which was ever after the delight of her heart,
as she found therein, thro' the Spirits teaching rich food for her soul.
Often has she related with great interest & heartfelt thankfulness
to our Saviour, that while still a child, she was led by the operations
of the Holy Spirit to a deep knowledge & conviction of sin; so that even
at that early period a solid awakening took place in her; for feeling
herself to be a great sinner, she then already sought & found grace in
the blood of Jesus, & devoted herself to Him, as His eternal property.
To this grace she ever after remained faithful, and as she advanced
in years she became more & more established & grounded in the faith
of the Son of God, & gradually learned more fully the lessons of His
redeeming love, sitting with Mary at Jesus' feet & humbly listening
to His gracious words. She attained at an early period of life to the
privilege of the B<sup>rns</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup> & often spoke with much feeling of the bles-
sing she enjoyed when for the first time she partook of the communion
with the Cong<sup>n</sup>. This was to her a truly happy hour of grace, she be-
held by faith the countenance of her Saviour, who then un-
parted Himself to her & made a covenant never to be forgotten,
yea [this at right margin]

Page 2
yea an everlasting covenant with her. Her feelings on this solemn occasion
are beautifully expressed in our hymnbook N<sup>o</sup>. 750 - "Great the feast, to
which thou Lord hast bidden &&&. - Such a worthless worm as me &&& -
At the early age of 16, before she entered into the Choir of S<sup>le</sup> Sisters, she was
employed in the care & instruction of the children in the Girls Boarding-
School at Fulnec, in which employment she displayed great capacity
& the most disinterested & persevering faithfulness, often labouring beyond
her strength, & ever willing to spend & to be spent in her Lord's service -.
During the 8 years she was thus engaged, she was universally beloved
& respected by all her pupils & had the pleasure to to see her exertions
in their behalf attended with success. She possessed an admirable
gift of bringing them forward in their various branches of learning, as
many of them even now testify with gratitude; but what lay nearest
to her heart, was - that she might be enabled to lead them, as the work
of <underline>His</underline> hands, to their creator & redeemer, & impress their tender minds
with a sense of His love to children. During this period her health
which was always delicate, tho' she possessed a sound constitution, fre-
quently suffered, which was partly the consequence of over-exertion
in the discharge of her duties. In more instances than one a decline was
apprehended but a visit to her parents in London proved the means
of restoring her strength & spirits, & enabled her to return with renewed
vigour & assiduity to the work allotted to her, & to continue in the per-
formance of it, which amidst many trials, discouragements & severe ex-
ercises, she constantly looked up to the Lord for His blessing which she
richly enjoyed. In 1786 her dear & much respected father was called
home to rest with the Lord from his labours. She was present on 
the mournful occasion & received his farewell blessing. This event
affected her very deeply. On May 15<sup>th</sup> 1787 she was married to her
surviving husband, our dear B<sup>r</sup> Frederic William Foster, according
to the gracious leading of our Lord, & soon after they removed to Lon-
don, B<sup>r</sup> Foster having been appointed Secretary to the English Provinc-
ial Helpers, the B<sup>rn</sup> Wollin [?] & Tho<sup>s</sup> Moore. In 1789 they travelled to-
gether to Germany & attended the General Synod, held at Herrnhut
with real blessing & profit. On their return to England they received
an appointment as aspirants in the service of the Cong<sup>n</sup> at Bedford,
where they remained till 1793 having for the last year of their stay
there, the entire care of that Cong<sup>n</sup> committed to them as B<sup>r</sup> Yarrel
had become wholly incapacitated by illness. Wyke was the next
sphere of their labours & during their abode in that place, their 4
children were born, & by their parents from their birth, devoted to
that Lord, at whose hands they received them as a precious gift. 
In 1794 she was deeply afflicted by the departure of her beloved mother,
who had at the close of the foregoing year, spent several weeks with her at
Wyke, & had been present at the birth of her eldest daughter, at which time
she proved a great comfort & support to our dear late Sister.

In her distress in consequence of this painful bereavement she turned
to the Lord & His consolations powerfully supported her & alleviated
the pungent grief occasioned by the loss of her only surviving & tenderly
beloved parent. Some years after she had also the grief to lose her mother-
in law, whom she had always loved with much affection & had been in
return beloved by her; so much the more painfully did this renewed
bereavement afflict her, in which she participated in the most sym-
pathizing manner with her husband. In consequence of a severe
cold caught on her return from the continent in 1789 she had for
some time after been in so precarious a state of health, as frequently 
to cause her relations & friends great uneasiness. During her stay
at Wyke she appeared however to have regained her usual strength.
The natural vigour of her constitution enabled her to struggle 
thro' repeated serious illnesses, some of which brought her apparent-
ly to the brink of the grave; yet the Lord raised her up from time
to time to the joy & comfort of her husband & children. When
confined by illness & looking forward to the probability of her
dissolution, she was always calm & composed, her mind being
stayed on the Lord, & resigned to His will for life & for death.
In 1800 she & husband were called to the service of the Cong<sup>n</sup>
at Fairfield & our late Sister entered with cheerfulness & zeal in-
to the more extensive field for labour in his vineyard, now allot-
ted to her. Amidst many trials incident to her official situation
here, she was enabled to look to the Lord with confidence & to
commit to Him <underline>all</underline> concerns as well as the concerns of those
whom she was called to serve, in whose weal & woe she always 
took the tenderest & most sympathizing share. Her youngest
son & daughter were born in Fairfield & during her abode in that
Cong<sup>n</sup> she had the satisfaction of witnessing the marriage of her
two eldest sons, one of whom settled in Fairfield & the other in the
neighborhood Sheffield; by them she had the pleasure to see 3
grandchildren, who where [sic] constant objects of her maternal affection
& fervent prayers at the throne of grace. Of her state of mind during
the first 10 years of her active & blessed exertions in the service of
the Cong<sup>n</sup> at Fairfield, the following extracts from letters addressed
to an intimate friend, will bear most edifying testimony:
<underline>Jan 7 - 1807. she writes:</underline> you must accept of an assurance of my best wishes
& prayers at the beginning of this year, & particularly that our
Saviour may direct, comfort, bless & support you in the situation
in which you are placed for His sake & with a view to serve Him.
I trust he will enable you to begin your work with that cheerful-
ness which always arises from the impression that we are serving
Him. We ought to commit our course & all our concerns to Him,
with [this at right margin]

with the confidence of a child to a tender parent; but alas! we are
too busy ourselves; our minds are often at work, & we are apt to be-
come gloomy thro' our own perverseness. Our Saviour's words, that
we must become as little children, have lately been particularly
impressed upon my mind; & the idea has frequently struck me
that we deprive ourselves of much, by not putting our whole trust
in Him; nay - I have carried it so far as to believe, with regard to
myself, that in a few instances, I have retarded the accomplishments
of our Saviour's views with me by it. Do not think, my dear friend,
that I conceive this to be your case; yet I believe that it is not impos-
sible, considering all circumstances, that you may find your faith
& entire confidence tried. 'Tis true our Lord works by means, but
the means & the time when the means are to be resorted to, belong
also to him; &  upon this my dear friend must rest her confidence.
Our Lord will let it appear, that He is gracious & faithful to his poor
children in all his dealings. -
<underline>In November the same year,</underline> she writes: you were very kind to remem-
ber me on the 3<sup>rd</sup> being my birthday. I feel that the good wishes you
expressed were the effusions of true friendship. One year after an-
other goes, & brings us nearer to our journey's end. I could not help
particularly reflecting on this subject on my birthday; it appears
gloomy to me in as far as the children would be affected by such an
event, viz: being deprived of a mother: This is indeed a clog to me,
& binds me to this poor life, yet, my dear friend, I am now & then
favored with a sweet foretaste of the Joys to come - & at such times
even those dear & near ties are for the moment forgotten. How sweet,
how indiscribably [sic] sweet is the reflection - no. I will not say reflect-
ion but the feeling truth, that a day will come when, "all tears will be
wiped away & sorrow & sighing will be no more." May we both trust in those
beautiful promises & not give way to any thing, which leads us from true
simplicity in believing the words of our Lord; the more childlikely we
trust in him, the more reality we enjoy & the more light we have into
his word. With regard to yourself I can only say, that I trust, you will be
enabled, thro' our Saviour's grace, to be satisfied. There are some things very
grating, & yet must be borne with. & I know very well, one may be so
situated, that there is nothing left to support, but the uprightness
with which we act before God our Saviour. When this has been my case,
I can truly say, I have enjoyed more comfort & content than when I
turn our trials into blessings & we shall always look on those things
to which we have submitted with the greatest satisfaction. Do not
give way to gloomy ideas, but depend upon that help, which is of-
fered [sic] to us in our greatest need. We are wrong when we sink; we have
a merciful Saviour who claims all our confidence & who does require
our [this at right margin]

Page 5
our entire resignation to His will. May he support & comfort you, &
give you a cheerful heart, which views every trial with a comfortable
hope, fasts [?] a better face upon every cross. Our Saviour amidst all your
difficulties has blessed you abundantly, in spirituals & temporals.
My prayer for you is that you may let these considerations prepon-
derate & make large allowances for human affairs, the very best &
most prosperous of which are full of defect. I have great reason to
pray for my own part, that I may keep the mercies I enjoy always
in view; when I slacken in this my mind always becomes gloomy.
I could write much on this subject with regard to myself; at present
I only wish to express a wish for you, that our Saviour may enable you,
at this time particularly to case your burdens on Him & derive new
courage. To do that work with pleasure which in your call & measure
our God for you to do ordained! -"
The following Extracts are from letters, written to the same friend, during
the latter period of her abode in Fairfield.
<underline>In 1817 she writes:</underline> I cannot express in words, how much I am at times
depressed by a sense of my unworthiness, wretchedness & neglect of
what I am called to enjoy. I must sink with shame at our Saviour's
feet, & crave that forgiveness, which He is willing to bestow, I believe,
but, I sometimes doubt whether I do receive it. My feelings on this 
subject I cannot describe! pray for me, that I may be more faithful,
more watchful over my poor frail heart.
<underline>In 1819:</underline> I remember a time, when the history of <underline>"Dives & Lazarus" was
much impressed upon my mind; I was then quite a girl & earnestly
prayed to our Saviour, like a simple child, that I might be like La-
zarus & not like Dives, who had his good things in this life. I prayed
with great sincerity, & begged & to lead me in his own way thro'
life, so that I might attain unto the happiness of Lazarus at last.
The recollection of the above period of my life, has often led me to think
how defective I now am, in that devotedness which I then felt to fol-
low our Saviour's leading with me, whatever the path might be; &
how often a murmur intrudes, when submission alone ought to pre-
dominate. Yes, my dear friend, I do deeply feel & acknowledge
with a humble & grateful heart, that my path is, & ever has been
strewed with mercies, & that the loving kindness of a gracious God
& Saviour has folled [sic] all the days of my life. May he draw me
into closer communion with Himself & give me grace to depend
more childlikely on Him in all things. -
These Extracts abundantly testify what was the state of her heart
while employing her time & talents in the service of the Lord & his
cong<sup>n</sup>, as well as what method she pursued in her dealings with
her [this at the right margin]

Page 6
her friends, & all those who were entrusted to her spiritual care, a method
which won for her the most affectionate regard & fullest confidence of
all who had the favor to enjoy that care; for in that method she dis-
played the greatest faithfulness & uprightness, joined to the tenderest
feelings of sympathy & love, which always prompted her to make the
concerns of all, whether of a spiritual or temporal nature, truly her
own. Indeed she had learned from deep experience to feel for & wish
those who were tried or afflicted; for it pleased the Lord to lead her
especially during the latter years of her life, on a path bewstrewed with
some very severe trials, with a view, no doubt, that the blessing pro-
mised to those that endure temptation, might finally & fully be
hers, to wit: that after having been tried she should receive the crown
of life. In reference to some trials of this description, which owing
to peculiar circumstances, were of a very painful & distressing na-
ture, she expresses herself in her letters to a friend, in the following
truly edifying manner: - "There is a rest for the Children of God.
This my dear friend, is a hard dispensation, but tho' we cannot un-
derstand it, we are assured that our Lord is wise & good, & that some
great purpose is to be accomplished by it, it is no doubt intended
for my humiliation & blessing. - Amidst many failings arising 
in some degree rejoice, as well as mourn. The cup of affliction is
it, & much may the Christian learn in the School of Adversity -
but we often repine, lose our faith & confidence & thereby obstruct
our Lord's work. I have great need to pray for more resignation
to the will of our merciful Redeemer, in all his dispensations how-
ever dark they may appear. May we, my dear friend, cleave to Him
with all our wants & be favored with clearness & freedom to pray,
finding an open passage to the Throne of Grace."
<underline>At another time she writes (1819.) We can say with truth, that we have
derived many blessings by means of dispensations most painful
to us. Had our pilgrimage thro' this life been smooth, how many use-
ful lessions would have been withheld from us! - trials have often
brought us to the foot of the cross, & procured for us many subjects
for prayer & humiliation, the fruits of which have been our best
enjoyments & sources of the sweetest comforts. I know that this
has been your experience as well as mine; & we feel how great our 
debt of gratitude is to our Lord for <underline>all;</underline> - for our days of sunshine
& for time of gloom & difficulty.

she declared to her most intimate friends her lively hope & joyful
expectation of being ere long permitted to quit this mortal taber-
nacle & to be at rest with the Lord for ever. To her dear children
however she rather refrained from a free disclosure of her appre-
hensions that she should not recover this illness. As long as any
hopes of the possibility of recovery remained, her affection for
them induced her to conceal almost from herself the distressing
thought that a separation must shortly ensue. Indeed she did
not scruple for a considerable period to intimate a wish: -
that if it were the Lord's will, she might be spared yet a little
longer, to watch over their temporal & spiritual intersts &
to assist them individually with her maternal care. The
frequent visits of her children resident in other places, contributed
to enliven her during her tedious confinement, & the affectionate
assiduity of those who had the favor to live with her & personally
to administer to her comforts, was rewarded by many a kind word
& expression of a countenance with their beloved mother, which will
not easily be obliterated from their recollection. Tho' her parental
feelings continued unchanged to the last, of which she gave frequent
& affecting proofs, yet, at the close of her earthly pilgramage drew
nearer, it became more & more evident, that the Lord was preparing
her for his heavenly kingdom, likewise by giving an increased
measure of resignation as to all that concerned her children.
Whenever the conversation turned upon this tender subject du-
ring the last few weeks of her life, she did not hesitate to say that
her anxieties on their behalf had been graciously allayed by the
Friend of her soul & she could now resign them all, as well as 
her affectionate partner into those hands, whereon by faith
she saw their names engraven.
<indent>From April to the end of June she appeared at times to suffer
much in her mind, indeed her frequent midnight tears
testified that this was the case. Her daughter who slept in the
same apartment with her, often found her awake in this state,
& once waking in the middle of the night, she overheard her repea-
ting the verse: O that my sins might find their grave &&& and-
Saviour! till sight of thee I gain - may I this scene be oft revising! &&
And during the last days, with clasped hands & her eyes fixed, 
her lips often moved in fervent prayer, while she appeared 
quite unconscious of those around her. There were full eviden-
ces of the true state of her heart as deeply humbled in the conscious-
ness [this at the right margin]
