<placename>Herrnhuth</placename>. <gap></gap>He left the following written Account of his Path

brought up by my Parents to all good. From my Infancy I had
no Talent for the World, yet my Corruption lay the deeper. In
time I had an insight into the Holy Ghosts seeking my heart
which I then did not understand. At length I became <abbr>concernd</abbr>
for my Salvation, more particularly in my 14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi>. Year when I
partook the Holy Sacrament the first time at which I shed many
Tears. <gap></gap>After this I came into a Light wordly minded way and
went on some Years under Divine Patience, <abbr>Till</abbr> Divine Love
<abbr>Touch&#39;d</abbr> my Heart, and convinced me of my unbelief in the time
of <date>Lent 1719</date>. <gap></gap>In the Passion Week my Continual Prayer was,
that our Saviour would have Mercy on me, and grant me the
<sic>Benifit</sic> <corr>Benefit</corr> of his Precious Blood Shedding. My Request that he
would graciously Pleased to look favourably on me was granted
and I <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> Comfort, It came in my Mind that I could be <abbr>helpd</abbr>
if I would apply to our Saviour as a poor Sinner. But the Sinner
=ship was a Mystery, I rather <abbr>employ&#39;d</abbr> myself in Reading and An=
=xious seeking. To this was added thy intention to Marry.
After praying to God to give me a Person wholly devoted to him, I married

with 3 Sons and 1 Daughter, but has taken Them all 4 to himself
I <abbr>endeavourd</abbr> to the Uttmost of my Power to act up to the best of my know=
=ledge, yet my heart was without feeling, <sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr> Eternal Love brought
a Text of Scripture to my Mind at the time I was <abbr>employ&#39;d</abbr> in my
Business the Text was this: as many as are led by the Spirit <add>they</add> are the Sons

of God. This <abbr>caus&#39;d</abbr> me great Concern. I <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> and Sigh Shew me
thy ways <abbr>O</abbr> Lord that I may <sic>walth</sic> <corr>walkth</corr> in thy Truth! He <abbr>answerd</abbr> me I will
direct thee and shew the way thou shalt go, I will guide thee with my
Eyes. About this time there was a great <abbr>awakning</abbr> at <add><placename>Oderwitz</placename></add> which
I would fain have <abbr>joind</abbr>, but at first, fear of Man gave me much
trouble, yet I was convinced in my heart that I should find what
I sought. I went to <placename>Berthrelsdorff</placename> and heard <persname>Pastor Rothe</persname> preach
|:which I had done once before:| and in his Sermon he gave me
such a plain description of my State of Soul as <abbr>tho</abbr> I had before
told him of it. And now the <sic>perscecution</sic> <corr>persecution</corr> began which did not
terrifyme, I felt peculiar Grace in my heart, and had I <abbr>remaind</abbr>
in my Simplicity, I should have avoided many a heavy hour
But instead of that I came into self Workings, I went to the Parson
and told him my whole State he often told me I was in the right
way I should only pray to God to bring me further in his Grace
but no sooner did he see that I conversed with souls who were
convinced how wrong their former Life had been then he <font color="#005000"><abbr>indea-</abbr>
<abbr>=vourd</abbr> to hinder me all he could. The Meetings at <placename>Oderwitz</placename>
was forbidden, and a great Number was Arrested and taken to
<placename>Zittau</placename>. As I was much <abbr>concern&#39;d</abbr> about these people I went a
few days after to enquire <sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> they were set at Liberty or
not. Just as I came to <persname>Gottlieb Webers</persname> House 2 Men laid
hold of me and would carry me before a Justice, not knowing</font>
for what cause, I refused to comply, they broke their Sticks
over my head and so evil intreated me that I fell to the Earth
without <sic>Sensce</sic> <corr>Sense</corr> or Motion, a Number of People being <abbr>gatherd</abbr> the
Men made off, as soon as I came to myself my first thought
was:Lord forgive them. I went home and felt very happy
The Next day I could scarce hold up my Head for Pain. I now
<sic>keept</sic> <corr>kept</corr> quiet at home and only went now and then to Church
some time after the Lord of the Place sent an Officer to bring me
before him and <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> me, <sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> I acknowledged the Articles
                                                    <abbr>deliverd</abbr>

at <placename>Zittau</placename> against The Clergy. <gap></gap>I could not then do otherwise
but Answer Yes. <gap></gap>Hereupon he committed me to Prison. I was
quite alone there, and was often <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> if I would not change my
Mind, but I could not. The Justice tried the Serpents Wisdom and
told me I should only Ask Pardon and all would be well. I was in a
great Strait yet promised to do so. An Officer brought me then to
the Parson to Ask his Pardon. I thought with my tongue I will do
it, but my Heart shall not give its Consent. But no sooner had
the Words <abbr>pass&#39;d</abbr> my Lips then my Distress was greater than I can
Express. I <abbr>begd</abbr> and <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> Oh dearest Saviour! do not cast me off
forever. I went to the Parson and told him how I felt since my
Rescinding, that the blessed Application of Jesus Merrits and death
to my heart, was now quite gone and <abbr>Vanish&#39;d</abbr> He tried to make
me easy by saying It would be all well again in a short time
soon After Notice was given me by An Officer sent from the
Lord of the Place, That I should in a short time leave the Town
I went to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> and found there an <sic>Habbitation</sic> <corr>Habitation</corr>. In <date>August
1728</date> I moved thither with my Family <abbr>altho</abbr> with a Wounded and
grieved Heart, and went on in my Misery and Distress above
3 Years, and then My heart was Softened and Melted <abbr>thro</abbr> the
Love and Grace of the <sic>faithfull</sic> <corr>faithful</corr> Friend of Sinners so that I
had some hopes of Comfort. <gap></gap>One Morning when I took my
little <persname>Anna Rosina</persname> out of Bed I <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> her what Verse she would
give me, and she repeated such a Sweet Comfortable one
that my Heart was enlarged so that I could lay myself as a poor
lost Sinner at the Feet of Jesus and find all the Blame in me
then I found enough cause to be a Sinner and obtained an insight
into the bleeding and Sacrifice of Jesus in which alone I could obtain
Grace Mercy and forgiveness of Sins. <gap></gap>Soon after the dear Disciple
sent for me and <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> me <sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> I was willing to be in a Band
which <persname><abbr>Br.</abbr> Tobias Friedrick</persname> <sic>keept</sic> <corr>kept</corr>? This I <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> upon as a great
                                                Favour

and our Saviour <sic><abbr>oppend</abbr></sic><abbr> </abbr><corr><abbr>opend</abbr></corr> my Heart which was formerly <abbr>seald</abbr> up so
that I could tell my whole Situation. I likewise <abbr>obtaind</abbr> the unspeak
=able Favour to partake the Holy Sacrament with the Congregation
That was a happy Moment. I <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> on myself as a poor Sinner who
<abbr>obtaind</abbr> Salvation purely out of free Grace and Mercy and com=
=mended myself to the failthful care and Protection of our dear
Saviour, and the Maternal Tuition of the Holy Spirit. when I
arose in the Morning my first thoughts were <gap></gap><abbr>O</abbr> that I might neither
think speak or hear of any thing but thy Love and thee, <gap></gap>and his
Grace lead me happily, yet still a time came <sic>wherin</sic> <corr>wherein</corr> I felt myself
so cold and in such dryness that I <sic>staid</sic> <corr>stayed</corr> away from the Holy Sacra
=ment. I was much troubled and <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> our dear Saviour for forgive
=ness, and he again <abbr>bless&#39;d</abbr> me with his Peace. Just then the Word
for the Day was, Ye Husbands pray without doubting My Prayer
was. <abbr>O</abbr> let me in thy Nail <unclear>prints</unclear> see, my Pardon &amp; Election free
and I heard the Blessed words in my Heart: behold I have gra=
=ven thee in the Palms of my Hands. In the Year <date>1736</date> I
was admitted among the <orgname>hourly Intercessors</orgname>. Then I experienced
what that is to be with the Spouse quite lonely and to pray for
the whole <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>. Yea</abbr> for our dear Saviours whole Kingdom.
3 Years after I became Sick Waiter. I <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> our Saviour to give me
wisdom and an humble lowly Sinner Heart I was in this
Important Office near 10 Years and <abbr>perform&#39;d</abbr> it with great Will
=ingness. In the Year <date>1741</date> the <orgname>Priesterly Office of Night Watch
=man</orgname> came to be my Lot. My Bodily Weakness made me
at first somewhat <sic>Scrupelous</sic> <corr>Scrupulous</corr> but I soon <sic>recolected</sic> <corr>recollected</corr> the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr>
has <sic>apointed</sic> <corr>appointed</corr> the to it, if it is our dear Saviours Will that
thou shalt serve him in this Office he will give the Strength
to execute it, I therefore undertook it in his Name on the
<date>7</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>. of August</date> I <abbr>resign&#39;d</abbr> myself to our Saviours Grace and the
Angels Protection: And our dear Saviour gave me his poor
Sinner who had nothing but his Grace to feel and see that

Saviour. <gap></gap>And Since then, as Often as I have had the fa=
=vour of being Congregation or Choir Disciple, My heart
has <abbr>enjoyd</abbr> a new Blessing and my Cheeks has been wetted
with Sinner Tears. <gap></gap>In the Month of <date>June 1760</date> such
a Weakness came over me, that I was obliged to resign
my important <orgname>Office of Watchman</orgname> in <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> the <date>15</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>.
of June</date> being the last Night in which I <abbr>watch&#39;d</abbr>. My
Weakness <abbr>increas&#39;d</abbr> so, that I was in great hopes I should
soon depart from this Vale of Tears, but that Hour is not
yet come. I have been obliged to miss many fine Meetings it
is true yet his sweet Nearness has often made me many a
Happy Hour in my Chamber the <date>15</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>. of February 1762</date> I had
a most peculiar Hour of Grace which I no more expected in
this Life, which was that <persname><abbr>Br.</abbr> Gregor</persname> <abbr>surrender&#39;d</abbr> the Con=
=gregation Discipleship to me in my Sick Chamber It was
as <abbr>tho</abbr> a Stream of Mercy and Grace was <abbr>pourd</abbr> out over me
and I <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> that favour with Sinner Shame &amp; bowedness
and with many Tears! <gap></gap>Thus far his Own Words.
Our dear Brothers <sic>Charactor</sic> <corr>Character</corr> is known to the whole Congregation.
He was indeed a faithful Heart, quite in Love with the most
Fairest and Beauteous Saviour He was Legitimated as such
and we can give him the Attestation of his being a true
Liturgus. <gap></gap>He <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> without ceasing, and made it his
real concern to Commend to our dear Lords Blessing and
Protection the increase of his Kingdom The whole <abbr>Brns told</abbr>

often <abbr>express&#39;d</abbr> how weighty the <orgname>Office of Watchman</orgname> had been
to him. <gap></gap><abbr>Thro</abbr> our Saviours Grace every Night for 19 Years

to make Strangers praise the Name of the Lord, He has <abbr>refreshd</abbr>
the Sick in their sleepless Nights and reminded them of the
faithful Keeper of Israel the Watchman of Soul &amp; Body. The
more this Office was of Weight to him, the greater was his Grief
that his weakly Body obliged him to give the Post of Watchman
to the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> He then went on his Path in Converse with the
Man of Sorrows which <abbr>shorten&#39;d</abbr> the days of his waiting at the

time and <abbr>refresh&#39;d</abbr> his Heart at the Post Communion in the
Hall. Since then he spent his time in Stillness hoping and
Longing for departure and as often as he was <abbr>askd</abbr> how he
found himself his Answer was that he was happy in the Wounds
