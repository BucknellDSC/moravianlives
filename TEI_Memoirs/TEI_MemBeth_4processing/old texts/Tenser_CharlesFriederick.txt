Containing The Personals of our Happy deceased Brother
<hi rend="underline"><persname>Charles Friedrick Tenser</persname></hi> who departed this Life at <hi rend="underline"><placename>Barby</placename></hi>
the <date>13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of April 1769</date>. He has left the following account of his Path
<sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> Time.
I was born the <date>1</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi><date>of January 1704</date> at <hi rend="underline"><placename>Luzois</placename></hi> near <hi rend="underline"><placename>Nauen</placename></hi>
in <hi rend="underline"><placename>Brandenburg</placename></hi>; <hi rend="underline">Luzow</hi> being my Fathers Estate. I can well Remem=
=ber that when i was a Child and used to walk in the garden, it often
came in my Mind: I hope I shall not go to hell! of which I heard more
off than of the <sic>Gosple</sic> <corr>Gospel</corr> in our Family. When I was I was about 14 my
Tutor brought me to the <hi rend="underline">Saldrish</hi> School at <hi rend="underline"><placename>Brandenburg</placename></hi>, from thence
I came to the University at <hi rend="underline"><sic><placename>Frankfort</placename></sic></hi> <hi rend="underline"><placename><corr>Frankfurt</corr></placename></hi> on the <hi rend="underline"><placename>Oder</placename></hi>. About this time
My Father <persname>John Teniser</persname>, <sic>Councellor</sic> <corr>Counselor</corr> at the Prusian Court, <sic>whent</sic> <corr>went</corr> to
Eternity, and in a few Years time My Mother run <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> all our Estate
Which made her leave nothing undone, to engage me to enter into
Military Service, Advising me to go to a Relation of hers at <placename>Gorlitz</placename>
who was a Saxon Captain which I did accordingly, and <sic>inlisted</sic> <corr>enlisted</corr>
a <sic>Souldier</sic> <corr>Soldier</corr>. In the 21 Years I spent in the Army I made several
Compaigns, in which I <abbr>suffer&#39;d</abbr> a great deal both in Soul which had cost
him his Blood, and <abbr>follow&#39;d</abbr> me, notwithstanding I committted many
Crimes partly of my own Accord, and partly at the instigation of others.
Being in <placename>Poland</placename> and sent with a small company to Forrage one
on which the Lord Jesus shed his Blood and <sic>dyed</sic> <corr>died</corr> on the Cross. I was
quite <abbr>frighten&#39;d</abbr> at that could not sleep the whole Night laitconti=
=nually <abbr>Ponder&#39;d</abbr> upon it whether it was really true, that Christ hung
on

.10197.26019
on the Cross. As soon as it was day I went out in the Field, which was <abbr>cover&#39;d</abbr>
with snow, fell on my knees, and repeated a Prayer which I had <abbr>learn&#39;d</abbr> out
of a Book, for I could not pray out of my heart. Yet sin soon <abbr>overpower&#39;d</abbr>
me again. My first Campaign in <placename>Poland</placename> being at an End, in which
I made one at the siege of <placename>Dantzig</placename>, I was quarterd in a Saxon Village
near <placename>Herzberg</placename>. Here I got a Picture of our Saviour on the Cross, this
I <abbr>naild</abbr> to the Wall, and fell down before it on my knees, and <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> for
my Salvation, the certainty of which I had never heard one word off.
In the Year <date>1741</date> I was in the Campaign at <placename>Bohemia</placename>, we had a very
smart engagement, and when I saw so many fall at my side, My whole
load off Sins was <sic><abbr>pourtray&#39;d</abbr></sic> <corr>portrayed</corr> before me, I <abbr>sigh&#39;d</abbr> after deliverance for my
Soul, and made a Solemn Oath to our Saviour, that if he would
give me my Life for a Prey, and let me have time to be conver=
=ted then I would be wholly his. After this I <abbr>endeavourd</abbr> in earnest to
become happy, and believing a Soldiers Life was a hindrance
I <abbr>begd</abbr> for <sic>dissmission</sic> <corr>dismission</corr> and pleaded My Arm, which I had broke in
a fall from my Horse, but was obliged to stay till the Campaign
was ended, after which I <abbr>obtain&#39;d</abbr> my <sic>dissmission</sic> <corr>dismission</corr>, and knew not
to what part of the World I should go. At length my Tent com=
=panion <abbr>offer&#39;d</abbr> to take me to his Farm in <placename>Th&uuml;ringen</placename>, I went
thither, begging our Saviour on the way that he would bring
me to a <hi rend="underline">Peter</hi> or send such a one to me, as he did the Cen=
=turion in the Acts of the Apostles, that I might hear Words of
Life. Then I shed the first Tears for my Salvation, and <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> I
should be heard. I did not stay long in <placename>Th&uuml;ringen</placename>, refused several
offers which was made me here and elsewhere, and resolved to go to my
Sister who lived beyond <placename>Sorau</placename>; In <placename>Sorau</placename> I <sic>staid</sic> <corr>stayed</corr> some weeks with=

[page break]

without hearing anything of the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: <sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr> my Landlord told me the <sic>Minester</sic> <corr>Minister</corr>
here was a Brother, and that there was several Pietests here. This <abbr>rais&#39;d</abbr> a
desire in me, to hear the Above <abbr>mentiond</abbr> <sic>Minester</sic> <corr>Minister</corr>, our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Brother <hi rend="underline"><persname>Clemens</persname></hi>
His first Sermon treated of Grace in the blood of Jesus, as the Price by which
we are Ransomed, and how one might obtain a certainty of our Salvation
here in time, yea even that very day. This was just the thing I wanted
a certainty of my Salvation. The Words <hi rend="underline">Ransom Price</hi> Penetrated my
very soul, so that I could not <sic>forgett</sic> <corr>forget</corr> it. My heart was convinced <hi rend="underline">this</hi> was
the right Doctrine, and thus it must be with me, and my thoughts
was: If <hi rend="underline">one</hi> man has <abbr>obtaind</abbr> a Certainty of his Salvation, I must be the
<hi rend="underline">Second</hi>, or I desire to live no longer. I could not rest till I could speak
with Brother <persname>Clemens</persname> myself, and <abbr>address&#39;d</abbr> him with the following words:
You are my <hi rend="underline"><persname>Peter</persname></hi> which I have <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> for, and I now desire you will fur=
=ther inform me <sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> it is Possible that such a Soldier as I am, who
has spent his Life in such a Manner, can experience that Grace.
He found no small difficulty to convince me of it, Joy, made it <sic>allmost</sic> <corr>almost</corr>
incredible to me. I then went home, fell on my knees, and <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr>
our Saviour to set forth an Example of his great Mercy <hi rend="underline">in me</hi> that
had been so wretched a Sinner, which I could not but acknowledge
I was and then his Name would be the more glorified by his being
gracious to such a wretch, and giving <hi rend="underline">me</hi> an Experience of the Virtue
of his Blood which he had shed as a Ransom Price for me.
This He did in such a powerful manner, that my heart was <abbr>warmd</abbr>;
and I saw so clearly in Spirit, how he hung on the Cross for my sins
sake, that I was <sic>truely</sic> <corr>truly</corr> Penetrated with the most Lively Affection &amp;
thankfulness towards him, and I lay at least an Hour prostrate
before him. I <abbr>surrender&#39;d</abbr> myself <sic>intirely</sic> <corr>entirely</corr> up to him Soul and Body,
and promised to be <sic>wholy</sic> <corr>wholly</corr> his Property. The Kind gracious Look
which he gave me, was so clear and lively to my Heart, that I never
can

.10197.26020
can forget it. I acquainted Brother <persname>Clemens</persname> with what had happend
and told him I had now <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> a certainty of my Salvation, and
Rejoicied him greatly with this News. <sic>Tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> he had enough to do, to
<sic>Perswade</sic> <corr>Persuade</corr> me to Stillness. I now had an inexpressible Love for the
Bible, and Child likely <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour to give me a <hi rend="underline">greater</hi> Cer
=tainty of my Salvation, and to confirm it to me <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> the Precious
words and Promises of holy Scripture. I cannot express how sweet
every Verse, yea every Word, was to my heart. hitherto I had not
heard a word of the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> at length <abbr>Br</abbr>. <persname>Clemens</persname> one day said to me
Well, what will you do now, I shall soon go to the Congregation? I <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr>
him to tell me what he meant by the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> upon which he gave
me a short <sic>Discription</sic> <corr>Description</corr> of the same. I presently <abbr>answerd</abbr>: I must go
to that People. And that not difficulties might be made, on account
of my Support, I said I would be content with Bread &amp; Water.
But oh how graciously has our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour dealt with me, for he
has given me far more than ever I expected. Soon after <abbr>B.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi>
<persname>Clemens</persname> set out to <placename>Ebersdorff</placename>, and 6 Weeks after I followed him
with <abbr>B.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> <persname>Woltersdorff</persname>, and <sic>arived</sic> <corr>arrived</corr> there the <date>19</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of October 1745</date>.
In the first Meeting I was in the Verse was sung: Thou hast thy
=self <abbr>reveald</abbr>, within my Conscious heart, my Jesus clearer than the
Sun, I see thy wounds and smart &amp;c<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> at the singing of which I had
a Sensation <sic>allmost</sic> <corr>almost</corr> as at the time I first <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> grace, and wept
for Joy and thankfulness. Some time after this; I partook the
Body and Blood of Jesus in the Lord Supper, and never shall
<sic>forgett</sic> <corr>forget</corr> what I <abbr>enjoy&#39;d</abbr> at the first Participation, it was to me as
<sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> I again saw our Saviour hang on the Cross for my Sins sake
and the hand writing blotted out which was against me. The <date>18</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>
of July 1748 </date>I came to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> and the <date>13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of August</date> following
Partook the Holy Sacrament with the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> in the Church at
<placename>Berthelsdorff</placename>. The <date>23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>d</date></hi><date>of May 1750</date> I was admitted to the Single
<abbr>Brns</abbr>: Covenant. It was no hard thing for me to pour out my
whole

[page break]

whole heart before my <abbr>Brn</abbr>:, and our Saviour gave me a New Assurance
of the forgiveness of my Sins. The <date>14</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of February 1752</date> I came to Dwell
School at great <placename>Hennersdorff</placename>, and had the care of 2 Saddle Horses.
Here, I passd <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> many Vissisitudes, as it was not yet become agree=
=able to me, to appear before my <abbr>Brn</abbr>: as <add>such</add> a Sinner as I was <sic>apointed</sic> <corr>appointed</corr>
Equery to the young Accademists there. Thus far our dear Brother
has wrote to his Personals. ______From the Year <date>1757</date> to the year <date>1767</date>
he has remarked from year to year, chiefly what his heart <abbr>learn&#39;d</abbr>
and experienced in Communion with our dear Saviour of which we
shall here give some short extracts. ___ Of the Year <date>1757</date> he makes
the following Remarks: &quot;Notwithstanding this has been a year of
&quot;great Blessing to me, yet I have found a great failing in me, which
&quot;is, the desire to become somewhat, and be more <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> upon than
&quot;I deserve. As likewise my Passionate and hasty Temper, robs me of
&quot;any Blessings. The <date>14</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of September</date> was a Remarkable day
&quot;in which unworthy I, was admitted among the hourly Interceptors
&quot;<sic>Thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> Grace I then felt what a Communion Subsists among us,
&quot;when one Sinner prays for the other.&quot; In the Year <date>1758</date> he
remarks how the Texts for the day were so suitable to his heart
and gives the following instance: &quot;I <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> my dear Lord to give
&quot;me a new and Powerful assurance of my being a Child of God. The
&quot;answer in my heart was a gracious <hi rend="underline">yes</hi>, and my tears said <hi rend="underline">Amen</hi>!
I <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> at the Text for the day and to my Surprise found it
this: <hi rend="underline">As many as <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> him</hi>, <hi rend="underline">to them gave he Power to become
the Children of God</hi> -- <hi rend="underline">and his Grace helps our Weakness</hi>.&quot; In
another place he says: &quot;I have found, that the Lords <abbr>Suffrings</abbr> is the
<hi rend="underline">only thing</hi> which can make <hi rend="underline">me</hi> a poor Sinner, it is <hi rend="underline">this</hi> which softens
the heart, and gives it true Life. This gives me great Pain, that I am
often so indolent, an Indolent Person does not enjoy half so much
as

.10197.26021
as one that is lively and watchful. In the Year <date>1759</date> he writes:
I was very much <abbr>abash&#39;d</abbr> to see so many of my Companions, so thorough
=ly <abbr>chang&#39;d</abbr> for the better, and to find myself so wanting. But
since the Tears which Jesus has shed pleads for me, and will cer=
=tainly be heard, so I <sic>apeal</sic> <corr>appeal</corr> to him, yes dearest Saviour! I entreat
thee to give me daily a sure and certain sense of my <sic>Connexion</sic> <corr>Connection</corr>
with thy heart, and that will surely change my Nature!
On Lord Supper day the <date>22</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>d</date></hi><date>of February 1760</date> he remarks: that from
that day forward, he dates his cure, at least that then signs of his
changing for the better, began to appear. His words are as follows:
I thought othou dearest heart, if thou wouldst this Moment take me
to thee, how gladly would I go with thee with Tears of Love &amp; Thank=
=fulness. Now, how could I kiss thy Feet for my Grace Election, Like
<persname>Mary Magdalen</persname>; thou has forgiven me a great deal; therefore I love
thee much! The great Trouble I have had these many years
that our dear Saviour could not find me of Service to him in his
Affairs, is gone and over. I will do nothing but Love, and forget
all things besides. In the year <date>1761</date> he makes the following
Remark. Notwithstanding all the Grace which our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour has
<abbr>bestow&#39;d</abbr> on me, yet I find I am often mistrustful, and see more
and more, that I have a great deal of self Love and Pride, and
am too apt to think I am Neglected in my Choir. This dangerous
thing has been a great hurt to my heart, and <abbr>Occasion&#39;d</abbr> a certain
hardness of heart, Anger and Coolness, towards many a Brother
whom I <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> was made more off than of me. In the Year
<date>1762</date> our dear <abbr>B.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Testifies he had a blessed School for his heart
<sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> somewhat Painful, because at the Renewal of the Interceptors
Class, he was not admitted one of the Number. Yet his Joy was so
much the greater and <abbr>bow&#39;d</abbr> him in the Dust, as he became a
member thereof on the <date>2.</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>d</date></hi><date> of November 1765</date>; and he Expresses
him

[page break]

himself in these terms: It was a peculiar Blessing to me that I was
<sic>Apointed</sic> <corr>Appointed</corr> to Coy the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>ns</abbr></hi> Concerns before our Saviour, and became
more and more assured of being heard. I became seriously <abbr>concernd</abbr>
and <abbr>begd</abbr> the Holy Spirit to form me a true Child of God, and a
Liturgish Brother heart, that I might be an honour to our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi>
Saviour in all my undertakings.&quot; In the year <date>1766</date> the observes
that he had earnestly intreated our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour (notwithstanding
his bodily Weakness) to give him an <sic>Oppertunity</sic> <corr>Opportunity</corr> (and was it
only 1 half year before his End) of telling Souls what our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> <abbr>Sav.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi>
had done for them. But our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour took the Will for the
dead and spoke his heart to peace. Our Saviour likewise sought
to bring him more into the Evangelical Sinner=Path, because
he would not <sic>allways</sic> <corr>always</corr> appear to his <abbr>Brn</abbr> so as he really knew
himself to be, and because <hi rend="underline">others</hi> failings was more visible to
him than was necessary, which was often a disturbance to
the true brotherly Love he might have <abbr>enjoyd</abbr>, yet his Conclu=
=sion was on the <date>19</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>of October</date> the same year as follows:
I am determined to make the best use of all my hours, and see
<sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> I can not obtain my desire of being a Joy to our Saviour;
and as we was Sensible of the <sic>reallity</sic> <corr>reality</corr> of his <sic>atachment</sic> <corr>attachement</corr> to our
Saviour, we could bear with patience with his weaknesses, which
was become second Nature to him, and which cost him many
Tears. Our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour who looks only at the heart, never left
him behind, when he granted the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> of his Choir, a Parti=
=cular Blessing. his Age and Increasing bodily weakness
made him believe his time here below was but short, and he
often <abbr>express&#39;d</abbr> his wish: that our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour would take him
to himself, <hi rend="underline">and that Suddenly</hi>. This he repeated on the day of his
departure. Our dear Saviour made a happy preparation to this,
in <date>February</date> this year, when he became the first time Disciple of

.10197.26022
of his Choir <del>for other first ????</del>. He earnestly <abbr>wishd</abbr> our dear Saviour
would now give him the <sic>injoyment</sic> <corr>enjoyment</corr> of new Blessings, in the place
of those he had <abbr>miss&#39;d</abbr> off, and spare nothing which might help
to his Perfection, which he <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> to be at hand. In a letter which
he wrote about the same time, he says: O my Grace Election is
doubly wrighty to me. First to be ransomed, and then to belong
to the People who honour our Saviours <abbr>Suffring</abbr>, <unclear>hs</unclear> this enlivens
my heart. Jesu&#39;s <abbr>Suffrings</abbr> is the peculiar Power, which unites
us together. This our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Saviour has manifested to me, This will
eternally preserve <add>us</add>, and this I will bear wittness of, to the whole
world, and will follow this <hi rend="underline">Ensign</hi> as long as my Eyes are open.
His Calling, to instruct the Young Accadamists in Managing
the Horse, was a Satisfactory employment, in which he <abbr>serv&#39;d</abbr>
them 15 Years with great faithfulness. <hi rend="underline">The <date>13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date></date></hi><date> of April</date> he
rode to <placename>Gnadau</placename> on <sic>Busness</sic> <corr>Business</corr>, with one of the <sic>Studients</sic> <corr>Students</corr> on the
road have by <hi rend="underline"><placename>Zeitz</placename></hi> he unlighted from his Horse, and as he
was Mounting again, he fell to the Ground on the other side
of the Horse, the Brother that was with him, attempted to assist
him to rise, and he spoke a few words quite Sensible, but
presently sunk again to the Ground, and lost his Senses &amp;
Speech. He was brought<placename> </placename><hi rend="underline"><placename>Zeitz</placename></hi>, and <sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> several Remidies
was applied, all was to none Effect. <abbr>Br</abbr>. <hi rend="underline"><persname>Holesch</persname></hi> was sent for
from <placename>Gnadau</placename>, who just came time enough to commend the
departing Soul to his Redeemer in a few Verses, and to give
him the last Blessing to his departure. His Pilgrimage
here below, lasted 65 Years 3 Months &amp; 2 Weeks.
