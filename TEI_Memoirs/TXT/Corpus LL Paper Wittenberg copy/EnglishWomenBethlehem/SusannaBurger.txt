i Susanna Burger was Born in the year 1696 the 24
day of march at Staten island: my fa-
thers and Mothers name was nathan
and Catherin  Whittman: my father was a farmer
of a honest and Sober life, and Lived in good Credit-
 my Dear Mother died when i was 4 year
and 3 months old: my father took his mother
home and She took Care of me until i was 
 Eight years old, and then my father
married again, and then my grand mother had no
more Liberty to take Care of me, as She had
before. When i was Eighteen years old i
was married to Elias Burger in the year 1714,
by Whom i have had 7 Sons and 4 daughters
and when i had been marred 3 months i was
Baptised as my father was not a Bap
tist i was not Baptisd in my infancy: my 
husband and i Came to newyork that i Should
recieve the holy Baptism we went to my hus-
bands Cousins house, they askd me: what minis-
ter i would have? i Said a English presbyterian minister; and When the minister Came
he askd me Several  questions: he ask me also
Why i was not Baptisd on Staten Island? i
answered, i was  afraid to Let my father know
of it, beCause he was a Baptist
and  we had no English minister there as
a Churchman, and i told him i would not be 
Baptised by him; he ask'd me Why? and i Said
beCause he Sign'd with the Sign of the
Cross; he Sayd  Said nothing to me but about
that, but he askd me Several other
questions about my faith: but i answered but
Little and then my husband and Cousin was
Calld in the room, and we all Stood and he
askd me Some Church questions to which i answered: he told us to kneel down, and then he
Baptised me and Signd me with with the Singr
of the Cross but it Seemd to  me as tho' he
Struck his fingers upon my heart in Stead
of being  Rejoiced my heart Sunk in my body, o
the pain of my heart i cannot Express
i Slept but Little that night i thought
what Shall i do now i have made
So many promises how Shall i perform them
and thought if i Could Keep them i would
feel Ease in my heart, but i soon found
i was not able to perform them, as i thought
i Should do: i was much troubled but kept
it for my Self, but i had Little Comfort
from within or without: i then thought
to Seek it in good Books to read them
diligently but found no true peace i poor
 miserable Creature Live Without Comfort; many ways i tried at reading and fasting, but i remaind the Same for about Seven
teen year and then i hear mr Frahinghuysen
a Dutch minister Came from the Jersey
who Went onCe to Long Island to preach,
i understood Very Little Dutch that time, i
went to hear him his teach was in the 16
Chapter of St John: When the Comforter
Shall Come he Shall Convince the
World of Sin of righteousness and of
Judgment i thought by my Self, what he
would make of Sin and Judgment i could
 apprehend but of righteousness i  knew not
he preached Very  powerful i thought i
 had never heard Such preaching before
[?] affected me very much, and when he
Came of that Text of  righteousness, i was
Stript of all my  righteousness wich  which i had before
to  build upon before, for it was a very
poor for foundatian  foundation. i went then more ConCernd, as i was before, but i was glad i had
 heard him: about a year after i removed
to   new york and then i fell Sick my  friends 
Thought i Would die and i was ConCernd about
my poor Soul and could find no relief
or reLease for my distressed mind, but i Thought
i Should not die then, and  firmly believed
if i Should not die then reCover that the
lord would give that i Should Live him for then
i reCovered a  Little and we moved to Staten
island  again, where i found a few acquaintances which
was awakened, which made me more ConCernd to Seek
for merCy, and one day i felt very angry
for Something Wich  Which i thought i Should
not, and i felt So much  guilt that i thought
what Shall i do now  there is no merCy
and that night my husband went out
and when my Children was in the Bed
i  Cried for Mercy
