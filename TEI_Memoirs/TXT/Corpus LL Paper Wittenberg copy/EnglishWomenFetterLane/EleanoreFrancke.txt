Course of Life of the
married Sr Eleanor Francke
who fell asleep in Jesus
between 12 & 1 o'
in the morning of the 18th
of April 1827
at Malmesbury
Aged 64 years

A short memoir of the life of
Sr Ellenor Franeker, whose maiden-
name was Sutton, & who departed this
life at Malmesbury in the 64th yr
of her age.

I was born July 14th 1763 in the Par=
-rish of Brinkworth in the Country
of Wilts. - My Parents were mem=
-bers of the Church of England &
brought up their children in that
persuasion & in a very strict man=
-ner. It was their sincere desire
that all of their children should
imbibe the principles of the Chris-
tian Religion & have the fear of God
implanted in their hearts. _ In my
childrens years I remember to have
had drawings of grace in my soul,
& frequently prayed the Lord to keep
& preserve me for himself & to guard
me from every thing which might 
be hurtful to me. _ My Mother of=
-ten spoke very tenderly of the love
of our Saviour to children & what
pleasure it gave him when he saw
that young people were inclined to follow
Him in this world, which at
times affect me much. However
with increasing years, I began
to have a hankering after the
pleasures of this world altho'
I often felt a remorse of con=
-science when I indulged the
thought of seeking to gratify
this my desire. When I was in
my 17th year, my dear Father depart=
=ed this life happily, which was
a severe trial to me, altho' not
equally as painful as if the
Lord had taken my dear Mother,
as she being at that time very
ill, so that her life was despair=
-ed of. This constrained me with
earnestness to beseech & supplicate
the Lord, rather to take me to
himself, than to deprive me of
my dear Mother, who was the
only friend & comfort I had in
this world. He graciously con=
discended to grant my prayer
& restored her to her former health, 
which gave me confidence
towards my dear Lord & Saviour, altho
alas in the sequel I often proved un=
-faithful to the kind leadings of his holy
Spirit. After the departure of my
dear Father, my Mother attended
the preaching of the Brethren,
finding more pasture for her heart,
than she did in the sermons at
Church, which were not so evan=
-gelical. Sometimes she took me with
her, tho' I would rather have gone
to Church: but having a great
love for my Mother, I could not
feel at liberty to act contrary to
her desire. _ After having for some=
-time attended the preachings of
the Brethren, I began to have a
fervent wish in my heart to be
like those happy people of whom
the Brethren spoke & described
& who they said shewed in their
very countenances that they be-
longed to our Savior altho I did
not understand how this could be,
yet I ardently longed to become
acquainted with our Saviour. I felt
disposed to give up every thing if
I could but obtain this favour
but did not fully understand what
was the heart to him. He that alone knows
the secrets of every heart, taught me
by degrees to see into my own no-
-thingness & to discover the deep
corruption & depravity of my heart
by nature, & that unless I had his
holy Spirit to direct me, I should
remain unstable & fluctuating as
the water. _ Feeling this to be my
case, & being sensible how wa=
-vering I was, I thought sometimes
that it would be in vain to give
myself much trouble, & that if
I was to be saved, I should, & if not
that all my endeavours to attain sal-
vation  would be fruitless. _ Mentioning
once these thoughts to a Sister, she
replied, that she was very sorry
to hear this from me; I told her,
that it was my firm belief. She
then said, that she hoped our Sa-
vior would convince me of my
error before it was too late. From 
that time forward my ideas con=
-cerning the means of salvation
became quite different & I was brought
to believe that if I was not saved,
the fault would be entirely my own.
Thus was I led into a childlike
disposition of heart, and I prayed fer=
=vently to our Saviour to bring me
into that path which leadeth to
eternal life. _ About this time
my dear Mother departed this life
in almost a sudden manner & I
believe she went happily to our
Saviour, since it was her daily
prayer to be prepared for this
important change. This took place
in December 1788. I shall never forget
in what a wonderful manner our
Saviour supported me on this most
trying occasion. I had formerly spent
many anxious hours in thinking that
I could never bear to live in this world,
in case my tenderly beloved Mother
was taken from me, & had often entreat=
=ed the Lord in prayer to take me first
to himself, but as He did not see good
to comply with my petition, He gave
me grace at that juncture, to cast all
my care upon Him, who careth for the
poor & distitute. Being thus situated
by this bereavment, I begged our dear
Saviour to direct my steps & to make a 
way for me to come thro' this life, ac=
-cording to His mind. I had at that time
various thoughts & ideas concerning the
Brethrens Congregation, for tho' I had attend=
-ed their meetings I yet knew very
little concerning their constitution,
however I was soon convinced & firmly
believed that this was the people to
whom I should belong. _ Being timo=
-rous & seeing many difficulties in my
way, & not knowing how to proceed,
I begged our Saviour fervently, that if
He thought I should prosper for him
in the Brns Congn, that he would, with
his own hand, lead me to it, but if not,
that he would hedge up my way, &
thus I delivered myself entirely to his
own guidance. _ April 9th 1780 I obtain=
-ed leave to live in the Single Sisters
House in Futherton, [???????????]
which was the palce I wished to re=
-tire in, if but for one year. _ I recei=
-ved this permission as from himself
& thanked him for it with bowedness
of heart. _ On May the 1st I removed
to Futherton, altho' I met with much
opposition on the part of my relations
for as none of them belonged to the Brethns
Congn & were entirely strangers to their
constitution they would not comprehend
why I left & went to such a place re=
-garding it as a wild scheme, They did
what they could to dissuade me
from going, but finding this inef=
-fectual they endeavoured to entice
me to remain with them, by making
me a very advantageous offer, but
as they found all to be of no avail,
they desisted & gave me up. __
In the Sisters House in Futherton, I
had much enjoyment, every thing
pleased me & our dear Saviour was
very precious to my soul, he let
me feel daily more & more of my
innate depravity, but at the same
time he comforted me with letting me en=
-joy his gracious presence & nearness. _
July 19 the year following I was solemnly
received into the Congregation as one of
its members, & what I felt on that occa=
-sion I cannot express in words, but my
prayers to the Lord was that I might
never lose the impression again.
Aug.st 29 following I was permitted to
be a Spectator at the Holy Communion
which was also the means of a sick
blessing for my heart. However I had
to wait a longer season than I had
expected before I was permitted to
have the favour to partake of this di=
-vine repast. _ When I had been but
one year in the Srs house an Oe-
-conamy for young Sisters was begun
in a separate building, & I was among
the number of those who were selected
to enter it as an inhabitant; which
was a trial to me; but as I requested
our Saviour to let me live in the
Sisters house if it were but for one
year, I remember'd my request, &
was resigned & we lived together
very agreeably. _ In March 1791 I had
the unspeakable favour to be permitted
to enjoy with the Congn the body &
blood of my dear Saviour in the Holy
Communion, after waiting a year &
a half, which time had appeared
very long to me; especially as I ob=
-tained the other privileges of the Congn
as soon as I requested them. I was now
very happy & would not have exchang=
-ed my situation for all this poor world
could have offered me. _ In January
1792 I received a proposal to undertake
the joint care of a Boarding school,
which was to be begun the following
spring. To this I felt a great objec=
-tion in my mind, feeling my great in=
-capacity for such a situation.
I was in a great strait & laid this my
concern before my ever faithful Sa=
-viour in prayer, intreating him,
that if it was his blessed will that
[???????????????????] I should
accept this proposal, that he would
make it clear to me, for I was very
much afraid, that my disinclination
to such a live of life might be the
means of tempting me to act contrary
to his will, & He graciously heard
my prayer & made it clear to me
that I should do right in declining
it, & I never after felt that I had
acted wrong in following this con=
-viction. I lived very comfortable
in this small family, till in
October the same year, I received
a proposal to remove to Kingswood
& to have the care of the family of Girls there.
Our dear Saviour gave me the need=
-ful clearness in this case, so that I
accepted it in his name & in reliance
upon his help, altho' I felt at the same
time my great insufficiency being
however apured[?] that He would make
his strength perfect in my weakness,
In reliance upon Him I left Futherton
Novr 5 1792 & after spending a few 
days in Bath & Bristol I arrived on
the 11th at Kingswood. The family
consisted only of nine persons,
the most of whom were Girls. _
This situation proved a new-school
to my heart, as I had never before
been entrusted with the care of a
family. I felt great timidity,
being afraid lest I should spoil any
thing by my perhaps too great zeal
or inattention to the teachings and
lasting of the Holy Spirit. I was often con=
-strained to approach the thro' pierced
feet of my Saviour, as a poor needy
sinner, & to entreat him with fervor
to guide & direct me according to his
mind, & I must own, to his praise &
with bowedness of heart that He did
hear my prayers & helped me thro' in
a remarkable manner, in all those
concerns which had been committed
to my care. He has indeed been
every thing to me, & often filled my
poor heart with the feeling of his
which [????very illegible and faint]
divine presence, so that I could
go on with cheerfulness & look to
him daily for his assistance of
which I found great need. All
those who have to care for young
people know by experience, how
needful it is to teach them both
by word & example, how to act
according to the mind of Christ,
as alas what patience must be
exercised toward them. I can say,
that I had a sincere love for them,
& an ardent wish that they all might
prosper for our dear Saviour, & I had
also the pleasure to see that this was the case with some of them,
which richly rewarded me for the
trouble & anxiety I had at times
on their account.
In October a proposal of marriage
was made to me. This brought me
with an upright heart before the
Lord, & having seriously weighed
it as in his presence, I felt per-
-fect freedom to decline the same.
I continued in my proper calling
till October 1794 when I received a
proposal from the Unitys Elders
Conference to fill the office of
labourer of the Single Sisters in 
Gracefield in Ireland, which I
accepted in humility & no reliance
upon the same kind support I had hi=
-therto experienced from our Saviour.
Here I continued to labour altho' in
great weakness till I received another
call from the U. E. Confce to serve
the family of Single Sisters in Dublin
as their labouress, & where I arrived
May the 15th in the year 1800. _ I would
still remark that after having
received my call to Gracefield, I 
left Bristol Novr 6 & having wait=
-ed two days in Holyhead, I proceeded
from thence to Dublin where I [?]
arrived on the 12th & spent 5 weeks
in that Congn, I then travelled
with Br & Sr West to the North
and arrived in Gracefield on the 27th.
At first every thing appeared strange
to me, the customs of the country
being so different from those in
England. I found the family, parti=
-cularly the younger part in a very
unsettled state. _ Br Schaukirch
having come from Gracehill, I was
on Jaur 18th solemnly blessed for my
office. I surrendered myself on this
for our Saviour, & felt no wish to part
from those who had been entrusted
to my care. In the year 1798 the
well known rebellion in Ireland,
created much disturbance in the
North, but our good Lord protected
us from all danger. When in
April 1800 I received my call to
Dublin, it caused me no small pain
& perplexity. I had no wish to part
with this dear family, which was
now in a prosperous state, enjoying
mutual love & confidence. Fearing
however that I should grieve our Saviour
if I suffered myself to be influenced and
guided by these feelings, I prayed him to
direct me how to act, & felt that nothing
would relieve my troubled mind and
set it at ease, but to follow his gracious
direction altho it would at the same
time be painful for me & this dear fami=
-ly to part. I therefore accepted my
appointment to Dublin, as out of our Sa=
-viours hands, saying not my will, but
thine be done. I served the family in
Gracefield 5 1/2 years, & we parted from
each other with feelings of love & regret,
which I cannot describe in words. _
In Dublin I came into a new School
and the custom then prevailing that
the Inhabitants went where they choose
in the City, caused me much uneasei=
-ness of mind, as I considered it not
right & that it might prove deter=
-mental to the Spiritual course of the
Sisters, and as some of the older Sisters
in the family advocated the cause of
the others, I was not immediately able
to put a stop to such irregularity. _
my good old Friend Pd Benade was
however a great encouragement to
me, & I gradually got more at home.
In August 1801 I received & acceped a
proposal to enter into the married state
with the Widower Br Ignatius Sraneker,
who was at that time[?] Labourer & Min=
-ister of the Congn of the Brethren at
Gomerwall in Yorkshire, & having
taken an affectionate farewell of the
family in Dublin, I went to England
& we were married Oct 12 1801 in the
Church at Birstall. We continued
to serve this dear congregation for
nearly 6 years, & then removed to
Woodford & in the sequel to various
other congregations, experiencing
the support of our gracious Lord
amidst various difficulties & trials
and at present we are among the
small congregation in Malmesbury.
Whilst I am writing this it as now
25 years since we have lived together
in the married state, during which
period our Saviour has blessed us
with 2 Sons & 1 Daughter, but one of
our Sons he was pleased to take into
his eternal security in his infancy.
It is our most earnest wish & prayer
that he would grant our other two
Children the grace to live for him
in this world & to be his devoted
servants. _ I can truly say that
amidst all our failings we have
loved each other - had each others
real welfare at heart, & have been
disirous to serve our merciful Lord,
who has redeemed us, & his cause,
according to the grace given us, and
our small abilities. _ I have much
to be thankful for, in having a kind
and indulgent partner, who does
all in his power for my comfort. _
May our Saviour bless him abendant[?]
-ly for his kind attention to all my
concerns. _ I would still observe
that with regard to our Son & Daughter,
who both are employed as teachers
in our Boarding Schools, that I
ardently wish that they may give
their whole heart to our Saviour,
& he truly impress'd with his re=
-deeming love, and be enabled
to devote themselves to his service
in what ever way they may be
employed. _ Their prosperity lies
very near my heart, And I trust
my poor prayers will be heard in
their behalf._ I have to grieve
over much mispent time, In seeing
many faults in others, & in not deal-
-ing so faithfully with my own
heart, by passing over things in
myself, which ought to have brought
me to the feet of a crucified Saviour
with penitential tears, and to have
sought forgiveness with him. _
I am indeed thankfull  thankful, that my
kind & loving Saviour hath borne
me with patience, & unexampled
long suffering. I have, alas, made
him very poor returns for all his
love, & what can I say, but _ O take
my heart, & whatsoere' is mine.
Beloved Jesus, I'll be only thine. _
May our Blessed Lord accept me,
poor & worthless as I am, as his
blood-bought property, & guide
me by his Holy Spirit, till that
happy time shall arrive, when
I shall be called over to his arms of
love._ My petition is "Here comes a
sinner who would fain, thro' the
Lambs ransom entrance gain" _
I am frequently reminded by
my kind & gracious Lord, that this
is at no great distance, by the great
dibility[?] I feel from day to day.
May his Holy Spirit lead me through
the last stage of this probationary
state, so that I may leave close
to him by faith. I must beg my
dear partner to forgive my mani=
fold mistakes in offending him,
                                          which
which have not been intentionally,
yet I know it has been the case re=
=peatedly. Oh, when I look back
on my past life, what need have I
to prostrate in the dust before our
Saviour; no one has more reason
to admire the long suffering & pa=
-tience of my best friend & Saviour.
Oh, that to his praise, each blood=
=drop within me were hallowed
always. I have now to look for=
-ward when this great change will
come. O Lord! grant that I may
be found ready to enter into my Redeem
=ers kingdom. At what time thou
mayest call me hence, give me to
feel daily more of that love
which urged thee to die, to fit and
prepare me for the meanseons[?] of
bliss.
The following prayer was found
among her manuscripts Dated
Fairfield July 1817
O my dear & merciful Saviour,
who hast laid down thy most in=
valuable life, for me a lost and
undone sinner. Thou didst sub=
-mit to that cruel & ignominous death
on the cross, that I might become
an heir of eternal life & salvation.
O grant that My precious blood may
cleanse my polluted soul, from
every spot & stain of sin, and so
draw me by thy grace unto thyself
that I may with new life in my
soul be strong thence to run my
appointed race more pleasing unto
thee. Grant unto me the undwelling
of thy Holy Spirit to guide my steps
aright. Altho' I am now arrived
to 54 years of age, I feel daily
more need of thy divine assis=
-tance, and most humbly intreat
thee to fill my soul with love and
peace, that love which urged thee
to die for my sins. Grant, most
gracious Redeemer & Saviour, that
the remainder of my days, may
be spent in sweet communion
with thee. I feel conscious that
I have not inproved my time as
I might have done, enjoying all
those priviledges  privileges in thy dear
Brethrens Congn & which causes
me to prostrate at thy thro' pierced
feet & to bathe them with peni=
=tential tears. _ Oh that thou
wouldst wash all my sins away
thro' thy atoning sacrifice. _
Strip me of every idol, which
may be a hindrance to thy work
of grace. The time is short,
may I not lose on moment,
But improve every opportunity
in making my calling & election
sure. I own it the highest pri=
=veledge  priviliege here below, to be employed
in thy service, & which I have
been now 25 years. But when
I reflect on my conduct in many
instances, how much self love
there has been entwined in
every action, thou alone knowest
what grief this has caused me at
times, yet how apt have I been
to fill into that dangerous path
again. O that thou, my dearest
Lord & Saviour, wouldst condescend
to
to look in mercy on me, and
guide me safe thro' this vale of
tears. tis alone owing to thy love,
patience, & tenderness that I have
been spared so long. May the continual
remembrance of this be a powerful magnet
to draw my heart into union with thee,
so that death itself shall never part,
mine & my Redeemer's heart. Grant that
my dear partner in life, may be strength=
-ened by thy grace & should it be thy
blessed will, that I should be called out
of time into eternity, support him by
thy gracious presence, that he may be
enabled to acquiesce in thy leadings,
for to thee he hath devoted himself.
Grant that our 2 dear children, may
be thy children. _ O take them into
thy hau[?]s anew, & form & fashion them
according to thy mind. May their dear
Father impress upon their minds the im=
-portance of being wholly given up to
thee in their youth & do thou crown
his endeavours with success, by laying
thy blessing upon it, so that if they
are permitted to continue for a time
in this vale of tears, they may be
useful members in thy Congn.
O, my most beloved Saviour, do thou
sprinkle their hearts with thy
redeeming blood, & fill them with thy
love, let them feel that they are not
their own, but thy blood bought pro=
=perty, to live alone for thee in this
world be their highest aim; so that
we may be enabled to say, when favord
to surround thy throne: "Here are
we, and the children thou hast given
us". Grant most gracious Redeemer
& Saviour, these petitions, which flow
from a heart truly penetrated with
thy special love to me a poor sinner,
for it is thro' grace alone that I hope
to obtain mercy. Cleanse me from
every sin, & forgive, for the sake of
thy blood & death all my transgressions
& receive me into thy favour. _

Under date of September 6 1822
Gracehill; is the following which
she had written but left unfinished;
What shall I say to the faithfulness
of my adorable Redeemer & Saviour,
who hath led me with such unwearied pa=
tience, but fall at his feet & devote
soul & body unto him who hath an=
-swered my prayer, when in distress of
mind, I expected my dear partner would
be taken from me, & not be permitted
to
 to see his children again. This ob=
=stacle appears removed, as we have
received a call to Kingswood, where
we hope to serve our Saviour in that
small Congn. _
From this short account of our late be=
-loved & respected Sisters course thro'
time, drawn up by herself, It is apparent,
that her earnest wish & prayer was to
enjoy in her soul, all those blessings
which our gracious Lord has merited for
his followers, & to devote herself to him and
to his service in the church of the Brethren.
She was indeed deeply sensible that she
was a sinner, & that all her happiness &
salvation was free grace & mercy, flowing
from the merit of Christs blood & death.
She took great delight in frequenting the
assemblies of Gods People, & never suffered
any thing to prevent her attendance, even
when it was thought not advisable on
account of her great dibility. She often
mourned over those, who on any trivial oc=
-casion would vacate their seat in the
house of God, or suffer their secular
concerns to interfere with the higher
duties of their soul. Her sincereity
in her attachments to her Saviour & his
service to which she had devoted herself
was very edifying. Her husband has
lost in her an affectionate partner,
who made it her study to afford him
                                                  every
every comfort that lay in her
power, & who was truly devoted to
her Saviour, & to those services to
which they were called in the
church of the Brethren. _
Her children have lost in her an
affectionate, faithful, & discreet mo=
-ther, who was always solicitous to
promote their present & eternal
happiness. So the poor she was,
as far as her abilities went a be=
=nevolent friend. She had been in
a declining state of health for
several years, having had repeated 
paralytic seizures, the last of
which she had on March the 11th
which [??]ned her left side and
rendered her left hand almost useless,
from whence it became evident that
her continuance here below could not
be much longer. She was herself
aware of it, & often spoke of her dis=
-solution as not being far distant. _
her mind was fully prepared to meet
this event, & her humility & confidence
in her Saviour, & love to him, as also
the gratitude she expressed for all
the mercies & favors she enjoyed
was very edifying. She had no
doubts & fears to perplex her mind
regarding her final acceptance
and eternal safety, but spoke of her
departure with serenity & composure,
& with a full conviction of her
intrest in our Saviours merits &
death. She attended all the meet=
-ings in the Chapel during the Pas=
=sion Week. But on the Friday
preceding her departure, she was
troubled with an obstinate cough
& which was attended with sickness
& a continual inclination to sleep,
however she did not take to her bed
till Tuesday the 17th April, when she
was seized with a lethargy, which
prevented her from saying much.
She requested her husband on that
day to bless her for her final depar=
-ture, which he did, after having commen
=ded her in a fervent prayer to our
Lord & Savior, beseeching him to
support her in her dying moments
by the feeling of his divine peace
& presence, & to receive her dear
bought soul into his presence above,
thanking him for all the grace &
mercy he had bestowed upon her here
below, & delivering her up into his
faithful hands. She said I shall
go to our Saviour. She continued the
most part of her time to a cup
till about 25 minutes before one
o'c on Apl 18th she breathed
her last in an easy & peaceful
manner, and her redeemed soul
went over into the presence
of her Lord & Saviour, there
to enjoy in fullest measure
what he has prepared for them
that love him & wait for
his appearing. She now rests
with Jesus, & our loss is her
eternal gain. She was in
the 64th year of her age. _
