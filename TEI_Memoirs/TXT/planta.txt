Memoir of the Life of our late venerable and happily departed Br Peter Jacob Planta, who entered into the joy of his Lord, at Ockbrook, May the 6th 1815, in teh 94th year of his age, written by himself.

I was born at Jonkisbring or town in Sweden, Dec. the f5h, old style in the year 1721. My Father's name was Jacob Planta & my Mother's maiden name Martha Ruda. They were both of the Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters, the [one] was born during my Mother's marriage to her first husband, whose name was Peter Shilling. Our Parents spared no pains in giving us a religious & genteel education; we had morning & evening prayyyers in the family, to which the servants were also admitted. 
My dear Mother would often read in the bible, & after prayers, read to me - take [] to us pleasing scritoral his-
tories, especially such as had a reference to the life, suffering & death of our dear Lord & Saviour, & also his [connection]
with

with his disciples & some of the []
time which the latter had to endure for his sake. On such occasions I used to sit on her lap, & sometimes asked what reward the disciples had for this faithful-ness to our Saviour, to which she replied: "They are richly rewarded for they are now exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly kingdom, singing his praises, & adoring him for ever." I said with tear, O my dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at the time our Saviour was upon earth, I also would have served him & suffered for his sake. My Mother replied weeping, "my dear child, if you had lived at that time you might perhaps have been of the number of those who cried out, crucify hiim! crucify him! " I said, O no, I never would, but I should have loved him dearly. She then blessed me, & prayed the Lord to keep me as his property, & to preserve me throughout my future life from sin, & the seductions of this evil world, until I should be with him in his heavenly kingdom, & then added that all those who loved & served him here, would share in the same blessings which his disciples did. This made a deep impression on my mind, & was the first time when I []
but 

but to have felt a real & tender love & attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour & in the sequel I always wished & prayed that I might become & remain a true child of God. When I was about 4 years of age, I experienced a remarkable preservation of my life. Having run out of the house [], with a spoon in my hand, I came to Lake Witter, which was not far distant from our house, & there being a broad plank laid over the water I got to the end of it, & was sitting on it playing with the spoon, admiring the drops which appeared to me like pearls. 
A woman who came to fetch water, called out to me to take care that I did not fall into the water, to whom I replied: I will not fall in, but she had scarcely returned to the house before she thought that she heard a plunge in the water, upon which she set down her pail, & ran towards the lake. Perceiving me in the water, she ventured in, & with difficulty caught hold of me by the hair of my head, & drawing me out, she laid me across the plank, believing me to be dead. She then carried me home to my Parents, who, with the whole family were 
greatly

greatly alarmed, & exceedingly distressed, as they could perceive no signs of life in me. I was however put into a warm bed, & after some time, while they were lamenting over me, I came to myself & said dear Mamma don't cry for me. I am here, & to the great joy of the whole family, I recovered. As I increased in years, I experienced several preservations of my life, having been in danger of losing it, both by fire & water, & once escaped being murdered. My Parents being desirous to give me a good education, procured a private Tutor in the house, until I went to a large school, in which I continued till my Father's happyp depar-ture, which took place in my 10th year. 
My Mother's intention was that I should continue my studies, wishing me to be a Minister of the Gospel, which also accord-ed with my inclination. However a Relation persuaded my Mother to put me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon & Apothecary in Gothenburg. Here I had a favourable opportunity to learn Pharmacy & chemistry, & as my master had very extensive practice, & employed me to visit his patients, I gradually began to practice myself, & gave considerable satisfaction to my employer.
Having been awakened to a sense of
my

my lost condition, I was for several years much concerned for my salvation, yea I may say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost carried on his work in my heart, by which I was presented from many sinful things.
I did frequently fall into sin, repenting & sinning alternately, so that when I would do good, ever was present with me. I felt frequently a great desire to separate myself from the world, & used to walk in the fields, where I could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour in which I took great delight. At such times I felt much pleasure in singing praises & thank[scratch]ing God; & nothing afforded me greater joy, than to thank our Saviour for the many preservations I had experienced from him, when in danger of my life. However I also, alas! often forgot myself, & gave way to levity when playing with my companions. But the good spirit of God frequently reminded me to seek the <underscore>One thing needful. I felt strong desire to be a child of God, & when I was invited with my Parents to entertainments, at which was music & dancing, I felt afterwards, great un-easiness, & like one who is sick, not understanding properly the accusations of my conscience. When I was about 13 years of age I ahd a great desire to enjoy the Holy Comn, for which preparing

I succeeded him. In the year 1754, I
had the favor to attend the Provincial
Synod of the Brn held at Lindsay house
which proved of great use & blessing to me.
April 10th 1755, I married my late dear
wife, whose maiden name was Sierin
June 20th I kept my first public ad-
dress to the Congn on the text: Whosoever
[]shall confess me before man, him
will I confess before my Father which is 
in Heaven. Math 10 32.
Have recd & accepted a call to serve
the mission in Jamaica, as also
late Br John Brown, we went, Jan 1-
2. 1759, on board the Dispatch Capt. 
Carter at Gravesend, & set sail in the
morning, but were obliged to cast an-
chor in the evening. The day proving
very stormy, caused us, & several other
Passengers to be sick, & we were obliged
to be at anchor a fortnight, but 
spent our time, while <del>at</del> in the Downs, in a 
blessed manner, reading the harmony of the 4
Gospels, & enjoying the presence of the Lord,
whilst singing in fellowship his praise. The
20th early in the morning, a signal was made
for the fleet to get under weigh. We
were about 250 vessels in Co, besides
small craft, & about noon we passed by
Downs with a favorable wind, & the 21st 
cast anchor off Portsmouth, we employed
our time in writing to our friends in
London

p. 21
London. The 23d early, our ship's crew
attempted to seize a boat, & leave the
vessel, the mate having offended them, &
oblidging they were too few in number to
navigate the vessel, however the Captain
restored order, & procured several addition-
al hands on board; about 11 p.m. we pro-
ceeded with a favorable breeze, but the
following day, the weather becoming []-
nous, we grew very sick. During the 
night, 2 ships ran foul of each other,
& one of them received considerable damage,
& was obliged to put back. The 25th
the wind ran very high, however I recovered
so far that I could keep out of bed, for
which I was very thankful. The 30th
we were driven to the Irish coast; &
entered the harbor of Kinsale, where 
we went on shore, & as our Captain
apprehended we should have a tedious
passage, he advised us to lay in more
provisions. My wife & I therefore went to
a shop to purchase what was needful.
The Master & Mistress who were elderly
people, inquired if we had come with
the fleet from London, to which we 
replied that we had. They said: May
God forbid! I asked why? They added,
and appeared very unsuitable for Jamai-
ca, since none but such whose character
[] had went to that Island, & they
would

p. 22
would advise us to relinquish the
voyage, & as I was in the medical
line, they wished we would reside with
them, & they would lodge & borad us, &
as they had many friends in the Town who
would be glad to employ me, I should soon
have plenty of practice, or if we pre-
ferred returning to London, they would
send us free of expense thither in one of
of their own vessels, which would sail in 
a few days -- Thanking them for this
kindness to strangers, as we were to
them, we replied that it was our in-
tention to proceed. They asked, what could
induce us to proceed in such a step? I
added, that altho' I might probably
practice physic & singing in that
Island, yet my chief design was to preach
the gospel to the Negro slaves & endeavor to be
instrumental in turning them from darkness to
light, & from the power of Satan unto God
their Saviour. They replied - Then go in
the name of God, for this is a good work, &
we should be sorry to hinder it.
April 18th, we got sight of Jamaica,
having been 5 months on board, & were
truly glad, when on the 19th about noon, we
cast anchor in the harbor of Port Royal, we
hired a boat, & proceeded to Kingston, &
landed about 3 miles from Carmel. Colonel
Brook & his Lady met us, & bid us welcome,
inviting us to dine at their house, & sent
us in their carriage to Carmel, where we
met

page 23
met with a truly cordial reception from
our Brn & Srs, & who with us rejoiced
at our arrival & thanked our merciful
Lord for his <add>gracious</add> preservation on our voyage.
In this Island our late brother served
both in his medicinal capacity, & in the
Mission, as a devoted servant of the Lord,
spending his time & talent for that Saviour,
whom he truly loved, & in whom he had found
pardon, peace, & eternal life. In those
Diaries which he kept during his abode 
in that Island, it appears that he was
earnestly solicitous to promote the happiness
of those souls committed to his care, & that
during his services there, he endured not
only many hardships, but also escaped 
many dangers, but it was apparent that
none of those things moved him, neither
counted he his life dear unto himself,
so that he might finish his course
with joy, & the ministry which he had
received of the Lord Jesus Christ, to testi-
fy the gospel of the grace of God. A few
extracts out of his diaries will suffice 
to show his state of heart & mind. He
writes thus: "By degrees I got also my
share of sufferings, but which, in due
time my Saviour terminated, & which 
he enabled me to bear with patience.
They ahd a salutary effect upon my soul.
It was a delight to me to serve my
Dearest Saviour, which I did in preaching
his"
