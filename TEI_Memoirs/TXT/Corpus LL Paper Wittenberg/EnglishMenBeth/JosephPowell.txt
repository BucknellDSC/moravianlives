I Joseph Powell son of Caleb and
Ann Powell was Born Oct 8 1711 O.S
at hisquide near Whitchuzch in
Shrop Shier England
My Father being a farmer broug-
-ht me up (as he did most of his Children)
to the same employ - He being a
Prisbytarian  Presbyterian as also my Mother was
who in perticuler  particular usd great sercum-
spection  circumspection love & patient with me in 
& on all Ocassions . her method was to
retier  retire almost every Evening where
no mortal Eye say her Children
to lay before the Lord ever concern
respecting her familly  family & perticuler  particular
the souls of her Children - I at
about my 10 year had Observd that on her coming
from her Sinnerhous or place of ret-
-ierment  retirement She alwais  always securd to have
been weeping but on each such occas-
ion was uncomonly  uncommonly Affectionate &
& loving - at this age I once crept
behind this her place of retierment  retirement 
& hard with what earnestness she laid
My Salvation on the Lords Heart.

Heart . . this gave me a lasting
deep impression, I often from that time
under & by the sins which so easeley  easily bes-
-et me was woont to retier  retire alone to prayr
when I got easd from many heavy
presuers  pressures - but in this state of sining
& repenting (not knowing him who came
to set me free) I continud many years
till I hard the clear saving Gospell  Gospel by
the Brethren
At my 19th year I having long
been disinclind both with my employ
& Country life & as my only younger
Brother desierd  desired to stay with my Parents
I hiered  hired my self to a Factory by whom
in riding the Country my Heart grew
more hard, here I fell much into pride
& self admieration  admiration at which time I
fell & broke a finger on my Left hand
the which where heald remaining somthing crookd
brought me in fresh strong Convictions
that this was on account of my so much
having admierd  admired my fine straight hand
I again betook my self to Prayer
& off many tears, made many
promises of better Obedience on Conditio
=ons of Patience & mercy
At my ??? Year of 21st thro
                                            un-
uneseyness  uneasiness of mind hoping to find
better people & find rest for my heart
I travilled  traveled to London where I livd
9 years with a tradsman  tradesman in Smithfield
who trusted all his buysnis  business & cash in
my hands himself oft travilling  traveling ???
cuntrys  countries but on my being Awakend
he hated me he once tould  told me
that I rewined every servant that
came in his Hous  House there having
been 3 that became Awakened
In about the year 1738
I first hard  heard the clear saving Gospel
by the Reverd George Whitfield
which to me was the power of God
here I got the first hop  hope of being savd
by Grace & not works
In this my awakend state I viss-
ited  visited my old Minister whom I thoug-
-ht should & would have incouragd  encouraged
& rejoycd  rejoiced with me in stead of which
he endavourd  endeavoured to battel  battle me in my pers=
=nite woundering that I who had been
so long a Member of the H. Communion
with them shud  should now becom  become so unesy  uneasy
he having on inquery  inquiry found me
                                                            to

to have an unspotted Camictar?
adding that I must not expect to
know what would become of my Soul
till I Died &e&e woundering over my
shallow short sighteadness  sightedness I got quick
from him (it being night) & on my
hom it darted in my heart (viz) you
seek help & ease by the rong  wrong Man.
its our Saviour only that can help you
this. tho I had off hand but as yet not
believd being perswaded  persuaded that I had
much to do as Praying fasting
receiving weakley  weakly the ?? Sacrament
giving Almes & the like from which
now it pleasd our D.r Saviour indem[?]
to releas  realse me granting me to rest
only & alone on His Sacread  Sacred Month
word faile[?] to express the Happyness  Happiness
I enjoyd but having as yet but
little intercorse  intercourse with the Br.n som  some
Rich Merchant of the souce? buysniss  business
I was in (Oil Man) continied to porpo
sals of Marriage after I on thare  their
Creddit  Credit got a shop well furnished &e
here I became sore intangeld
that I againe  again had no rest
                                            here
here it oft Darted into my heart (viz)
If then doest this then thou wilt
be bound & weded  wedded to the World & remaine  remain
sould  sold under Sin & hazard the loss of
thy soul: here I was so stoped from
each persuit  pursuit of the world & the flesh
however Obsurd  Absurd it migh  might seem to others
I endavourd  endeavoured to get clear of all hoping
to becom  become wholey  wholly our Saviours & to
belong to his people: Immediatly  Immediately
seeking to becom  become Acquainted with them

About this time the Gentelwoman  Gentlewoman
I servd sent her yong  young Daughter in
my care to a Neighbour wher  where the
small pox was on purpose to Catch
it, but to no effect but our D.r Saviour
knowing the danger I was still in
of loosing my soul I being still full
with passion pride & self admiera-
-tion  admiration he laid me down on the
small pox (tho it was not then in
our Neighbourhood) in which I
belive  believe I suffered much more yea
wood  would much rather Die this put
such a stop to those Miserys  Miseries that
still lay in me that I thanks Him
for this unspeakable Mercy
with numberless Tears
