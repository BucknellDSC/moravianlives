The Single Sist<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. A. Mary Anton. The following are her own Words: I am born the 18<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of May 1739 at Pilgerruh in Holstein. but so they Congregation emigrated, I came as a little Child to [?] to Hhuth. But Anno 1744, my Parents took me along to Berlin, which was a great Loss to me, then I heard &amp; saw there many Things good for nothing for me &amp; had had not our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. preserved me, I had natural Instincts &amp; Occasion enough to commit many wicked Things. A.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">o </sup>1747. I moved w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> my Parents from thence to Bertholdsdorf, because the gat yet no Leave to come to Hhuth. Anno 48 we removed to Hhuth &amp; after a short Stay there, to Hhaag. Here I came soon to my great Joy in the Anstalt of the Children. In the Begin I was very happy, but my lightminded Temper made the feeling of our Saviour soon vanishing. Anno 49. the 25<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of March I was received into the Girls Choir but soon observed in the first Conversation that this meant some Thing more then they were upright &amp; Sincere &amp; that I could not do. In this year I came with my Parents to Ebersdorf &amp; served the, but resided very often in my Choir-House. I was here not long I begun to grow indifferent &amp; came by means of a wicked Compagnie in poor Circumstances &amp; became excomunicated for a time from by the Congregation till our Saviour bestowed Mercy on me that I could disclose all my hidden Tricks. </p> <p> Anno 53 in April I was received into the Congregation. I was</p> <p> I was ashamed about this Grace, but by all that I came not farther then my Heart was not open &amp; secure before God &amp; Man. I soon came in my former Snares again &amp; begun to doubt if it would come with me to any Thing at all. However Anno 54 the 24<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of Feb. as I toock a walk in the Field I accidently fell in a intime Conversation w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. &amp; could discover my whole Heart towards him &amp; so begged Mercy under many Tears &amp; that he would let me from This Day experience how good it is w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> a happy Heart to be in the Congregation. By this inter_ cource he was as near to me the as if he was visible. </p> <p> Anno 1755 the Month of Jan. I came in my Choir-House as wherefore I loockd out a good while. The first time I was happy again, but as I disliked to appear as such a wicked &amp; naughty Siner, then it didn't went as well as it could; but the Truest Friend of my Soul whose Patiens persecuted me from my youth, did not draw back his Hand, wicked as I was. They holy Ghost licke a true Mother begun his Work anew &amp; showed to me de deplorable Condition of my wicked Heart &amp; brought me in the most extreme Distress about myself. I conversed with my Laboures &amp; revealed my whole Heart towards her &amp; our Sav<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. as the great Friend of Sinners appeared to me again at in his unspeacable Nearness. </p> <p> Anno 57. 21<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> of March I became Canditat to the holy Communion, &amp; had so happy a Time which I shall never forget </p> <p> forgot. I lernt now myself better to know, became a more intime Connection with our Saviour &amp; he became many Sinner - Fears before his pierced feet. the 14<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> May I was confirmed &amp; the 11<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> June the blessd day appeared where I was to partake on his holy Body &amp; Blood here I lost myself &amp; could nothing but weep. the 20<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of July I receiv<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">d</sup> the blessing into the Single Sisters Choir &amp; I gave him Heart &amp; Hands to become his true Soul. Soon after I &amp; four Sisters more went from here towards Herrnhuth &amp; arrived the 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of August, where I had the Pleasure to live into the Choir-House. Here I enjoyd his happy Nearness as a poor Sinner, but weep daily for Want &amp; Insufficiency. His Grace &amp; Mercy is my only Holdfast, without, I easily could be come inshared again. My only Desire is to live as his Property to the Joy of his Heart, &amp; that his holy Corpse &amp; Blood may irradicate all what's unJesuslicke in my Soul &amp; Body. So far She herself. </p> <p> However [illegible] unsettled her State of Mind, She was for all that Sincere &amp; openhearted. Anno 1760. Our blessed Disciple spoke her &amp; from this Time our Saviour settled her Mind &amp; brought her to a sure foundation. She has been for a Time excommunicated from the holy Sacrament &amp; in this Interval the holy Ghost had his blessed Work in her &amp; she became solid &amp; certain.He certain. Her Happiess became more consistent &amp; She learned to know by all her Insufficiency &amp; Sinfulness to keep close to our Saviour &amp; on his meritorious Atonement. Hereby She found herself glad, servitable &amp; in Conversation lovely. </p> <p> It was a Pleasure to her to serve one of her Sisters &amp; her daily Work in Washing She did w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> all possible Care &amp; diligence. In the last Days of April She was taken sick on a sudden but resisted as much as possible, because of her Choci- Feast drawing so near. But a vehement Fever forced her that She willingly the 1<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">st</sup> of May entered the Sixth Room. On her Feastday was She very happy in her Room &amp; was glad to celebrate her approaching Birthday by this op- portunitity in this so Hill &amp; happy Place. The Watch Word of her Birthday was: Er riss muh heraus denn er halte Sust zie mir. Was muss Jesus an mir tr√ºben Herzen lieben? This was extraordinary pleasing &amp; comfortable to her. </p> <p>Privately She hoped if our Saviour by means of her Sickness would't take her in his eternal Safety, but this She believed was to great a Luck for her. By all her Smart She was always Silent, of good Cheer &amp; very lovely &amp; thankful to her Waiter. The 8th as She expected her Portion by the holy Sacrament, She said : A! When this would be be the last &amp; when I to Day were so happy </p> <p> happy to expire on his Breast. How well, how happy would this be for poor me! But effscarily She had receivd the holt Sacrament, then her to hole Countenance begun to change &amp; lay without Motion, but inwardly present to herself; She took no Notice of any Thing; the formerly so very acceptable Visits of her Sisters, became now very indifferent to her. Her Heart continually conversd w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> her only Friend: She made some Motions w<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> her Lips but nothing could be understood, &amp; between 10 &amp; 11 a Clock in the Evening her Soul departed to her eternal Home, after a Sojourning in this World of 24 Years, wanting one Day. </p> </body> </html>
