               <lb/>at times great Uneasiness which <abbr>press'd</abbr> Tears from my Eyes. My
               <lb/>Faithful Saviour followed me and brought me now and then to
               <lb/>beg for Mercy and that He would would work a change in me
               <lb/><sic>comming</sic> <corr>coming</corr> one time out of a very bad Company I was <abbr>ask'd</abbr> if
               <lb/>I had not been very Merry? My distress was so great that I could
               <lb/>not return an Answer, just then 2 Children came before the
               <lb/>window and sung: Where is Jesus my beloved and my Friends <add>a</add>
               <lb/>My heart and Eyes presently <abbr>overflow'd</abbr> and I hastend to my Apart
               <lb/>=ment to give my tears vent and felt unspeakably happy
               <lb/>I went on some time in that Sensation but not being quite free
               <lb/>from the World I <abbr>sufferd</abbr> myself to be sometimes drawn away
               <lb/>which brought into a State of Indifferency. Yet our Saviour
               <lb/>did not leave me, but made me so restless that I can say
               <lb/>of a truth I felt Hellish Anguish as all my past Sins pre=
               <lb/>=sented themselves before my Eyes. In this state I thought
               <lb/>I will be patient and let my God do with me as it shall please
               <lb/>him and should I perish before he has Mercy on Me. Then
               <lb/>our dear Saviour convinced me that true saving Faith in
               <lb/>him was wanting. In the greatest concern hereat I went to Bed.
               <lb/>It was to me as tho I was <abbr>ask'd</abbr> what I would have? Our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr>
               <lb/>Saviour gave me Faith in his bleeding Merrits, and pardoned
               <lb/>me all my Sins. My great Distress was over, my Burthren was
               <lb/>removed it was as <abbr>tho'</abbr> I was born anew and quite freed from
               <lb/>the World. In this Happy Situation I continued some time
               <lb/>and was quite another Man so that my whole Neighbour
               <lb/>=hood <abbr>wonder'd</abbr> thereover. I would fain have told all Men
               <lb/>what I <sic><abbr>injoy'd</abbr></sic><abbr> </abbr><corr><abbr>enjoy'd</abbr></corr> and went too far in that Respect, came into
               <lb/>Self workings and dryness. In this Situation I became acquain
               <lb/>=ted with <abbr>Brn</abbr>, who told me of grace in the Blood of Jesus.

               <lb/>I soon <abbr>conceiv'd</abbr> a great Love for them, all they said was <abbr>yea</abbr> and
               <lb/>amen to me, and I thought if there is Children of God in the World
               <lb/>these are such. From them I first heard of the Congregation
               <lb/>and it ways directly made out to my heart: I belong to that People.
               <lb/>The <date>12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi>. of June 1754</date> I went to <placeName>Herrnhuth</placeName> in Company with
               <lb/>2, Others; and the <date>17<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi>.</date> came to dwell in the Choir House
               <lb/>as I had been ruined in the World both Soul and Body, It
               <lb/>was my greatest concern Now to become wholly our Saviours
               <lb/>Property He likewise <abbr>display'd</abbr> his power on my Heart. The
               <lb/><date>15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">>th</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi>. of December the same Year,</date> I was <abbr>receiv'd</abbr> into the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr>
               <lb/>which was an unspeakable Blessing to me. I had happy
               <lb/>days for some time, but came off from that happy Sensation
               <lb/>and my Natural high Spirit brought me into a confused Situ=
               <lb/>=ation. When the Holy Spirit would lead me as a Sinner to
               <lb/>Christ, I <abbr>labour'd</abbr> against it, and would fain have made my
               <lb/>=self better than I was which was a trouble to our Saviour
               <lb/>and my <abbr>Brn</abbr>: who were often in concern on my Account.
               <lb/>The <date>first of November 1755</date> I partook the Lord Supper the
               <lb/>first time with the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr> and I felt my soul and Body
               <lb/>Penetrated there with, every time I have partaken this great
               <lb/>Good our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviour has been unspeakably near my heart
               <lb/>in his <abbr>Martyr'd</abbr> form. Yet the true Sinnership was wanting
               <lb/>still, My Misfortune was that I <abbr>look'd</abbr> more at my own
               <lb/>wretchedness than to our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviour, which Several times
               <lb/>caused me to stay from the Communion. <abbr>Yea</abbr> it came so far
               <lb/>that I <sic><abbr>sufferrd</abbr></sic><abbr> </abbr><corr><abbr>sufferd</abbr></corr> myself to be tempted by Sin, for which cause I was
               <lb/>shut out from the Communion, but our faithful Saviour gave
               <lb/>me an Open heart, so that I could <sic>apear</sic> <corr>appear</corr> before my Labourers as
               <lb/>I was. <gap></gap>And now my distress being at the <sic>Heigth</sic> <corr>Height</corr> I wept so long
               <lb/>before our Saviour <sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr> he anew had Mercy on me and

               <lb/>=ful care brought me more and more into a happy Path so

                  <lb/>of June 1763</date> I had the favour of being admitted a Member of

               <lb/>Soul and Body as his Patient, and found Sufficient Cause
               <lb/>to thank and Praise him for doing so much for his Soul
               <lb/>This he freely testified to others, and was for some Years
               <lb/>one of the Visitors and keeper of Bands in his Choir as well
               <lb/>as having the care of a Room committed to him. As He was

               <lb/>Jesus, He was the same in all things committed to his care

               <lb/>and could scarce be reconciled to it when his Ill Health
