                  <lb/>for our Souls Sake. I <sic>intented</sic>  <corr>intended</corr> to take some Linen along

                  <lb/>had pursued our Journey some Miles, we fell in with

                  <lb/>We <sic>knowed</sic>  <corr>knew</corr> what sort of Holes <add>were</add> <unclear>preport</unclear> for us in Prison;

                  <lb/><sic>inmoveable</sic>  <corr>immovable</corr> but at last they said, as we go for our Con-

                  <lb/>every Body. This we enjoyed every where, on our Journey
                  <lb/>till we at last save arrived at <placeName>Bertholsdorf</placeName>. We went
                  <lb/>the same Day to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>, where they was just a building the
                  <lb/>Congregation House, the Brethren which was on the Roof
                  <lb/>knowd us, came down, saluted us with great Joy &amp; Amazement
                  <lb/>that we escapd so happily. But as to the same Time was 
                  <lb/>no Employment for us there, then we lived 8 Weeks at
                  <lb/><placeName>Bertholsdorf</placeName> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <persName>Vater Nitschmann</persName>, but afterwards

                  <lb/>vided us a Lodging &amp; Boarding at <placeName>Kemniz</placeName>. But as our
                  <lb/>dear Lady a Year after went to her Saviour, we beggd
                  <lb/>by our blessed Disciple for a Place in <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>. We aquainted
                  <lb/>our Lord &amp; the Minister at <placeName>Kemniz</placeName> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Intention,
                  <lb/>But they disuadeth us: saying what we would do
                  <lb/>in this <sic>Desart</sic>  <corr>Desert</corr>? &amp; who would give us there our Allimendation?
                  <lb/>My Husband <sic>answerd</sic>  <corr>answered</corr>: Our Saviour who nourished
                  <lb/>4000 Men in the <sic>Desart</sic>  <corr>Desert</corr>, He hoped will find <sic>Advise</sic>  <corr>Advice</corr>
                  <lb/>to bring us there through to. We moved also A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1726</date>
                  <lb/>to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>, where we found several Trials in the first
                  <lb/>Years, &amp; I found out very soon, that the bare
                  <lb/>Emigration from <add>my</add> Mother Country, was not enough
                  <lb/>to set my Heart at Rest. The fundamental Him:
                  <lb/>not to belief on the Son of God &amp; his meritorious
                  <lb/>Wounds, was here laid open to me, so that I did't
                  <lb/>venture to go to our Lords Supper &amp; thereby lost
