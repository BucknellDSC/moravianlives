Life of the Widow, Sister <persname><hi rend="underline">Ann Kr√ºgelstein</hi></persname> by 
Maiden Name <persname>Gold of Moravia</persname>, who departed in <placename>Herrnhut</placename>
<date>Apr. 30th 1778</date>. She has left the following remarkable Account of
the Grace & Mercy the Lord bestowed upon her during her Life.
     I was born <date>July 10th 1713</date> at <placename>Zauchtenthal near Fulneck
in Moravia</placename>. Already in my second Year I experienced a grac-
ious Preservation of God. My Mother used to gather Grass
for her Cattle, & generally took me along, & laying me once down 
near a Tree, a Wolf came, placed himself close by me, & smelt
at me. My Mother felt at once very anxious, & turning
about to look for me, she saw the ravenous Beast with me.
She then run hastily towards me, and the Wolf went a few
Steps back, so that she could take me. My Parents reveiwed 
me anew as a Gift of God, and thanked him with Tears for
my Preservation, for they were both devout People; and 
having looked upon me from my Birth as a gracious Gift
of God, they endeavoured to educate me according to his
Mind, wept & prayed often to God in my Behalf & took
all possible Pains with me. In my 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I became
much concerned about regaining a Fellowship with God 
through Jesus Christ, because I had heard my Father
say, that we had lost it by the Fall of Adam, but that
the second Adam Jesus Christ had procured it again
through his Sufferings and Death. The Holy Ghost took

.10250.26226
me upon this Occasion into a particular School , stirred
up in my a Confidence to God, so that I could converse
with him quite familiarly, & preserved me in many Dan, 
gers from Deviations, giving me an Admonition when 
I was not on the right Track. He at the same time wrought 
in me a Fear of falling into Sin, and granted me the 
Grace to speak uprightly with my Parents about every
Thing. By which means I escaped many Temptations
of the Enemy of my Soul.
     In the Year <date>1724</date> there was a great Awakening among
the Children in <placename>Moravia</placename>. I heard that we must get a 
new Heart if we will be saved, & that God alone was able 
to give it. This occasioned new Perplexity in me, seeing
that I was deficient herein <add>&</add> I was much troubled. I at the
same Time looked out for some Companions, to whom I would
discover this my Concern, & our Saviour gave me eight who
had the same Mind; we often went into hollow Roads and
Bushes, where we were alone, & wept and prayed for the new Heart.
A Hope was also kindled within me, that I should become 
a Partaker of it, tho' I felt myself very unworthy.
     In <date>1727</date> the Persecution in <placename>Moravia</placename> rose to that Pitch
that Orders were given, that everyone should swear Allegiance
to the roman catholic Religion. My Mother who had a
faithful Heart to our Savior, would & could not do it, but

[page break]

resolved rather to emigrate. She asked me whether I would
accompany her? I consented directly, & the Concern of our Heart
to see our Souls saved, was so great, that nothing could detain us.
     While these Things were going on, my Mothers older Brother
<persname>John Nitschman</persname> arrived with us from <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, who emigrated
before us, to him we discovered our Intention , & he being willing
to accompany us, my Father made directly secret Preparations for
our Departure. And thus we left our House & Mother Country
<date>June 23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>rd</date></hi><date> 1727</date>, & set out for <placename>Herrnhut</placename> My <sic>Oncle <corr>Uncle</corr></sic> |: her Mothers
<persname>Brother </persname><persname>Melchior Nitschman </persname>:| who was in Jail at <placename>Kunewalde</placename> |: who 
at last died in Prison at <placename>Kremsir</placename> as a Martyr :| and to whom I 
brought from time to time what he stood in Need of; to him I had
discovered our Intention, shortly before, & had taken a very moving
Leave of him. He recomended us there to the Protection of the Lord, 
and said to me during a particular Sense of the Peace of God: " I
am sure I shall find thee once among the Number of those who are
with the Lord " On our Journey we were several times in Danger
of our Lives, & besides this had to suffer much Distress, Hard
ships & Anxiety. But our Savior helped us, so that we arrived 
safe, chearful and happy <date>July 2</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>nd</date></hi>. at <placename>Berthelsdorf</placename> to our unspeak
able Joy. The next Day we went to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, & were welcomed 
with much Affection by the little Congregation there. But we had
to live yet for some Time in <placename>Berthelsdorf</placename>.
     My Concern for my Salvation increased here more & more.
I yet remember that I felt something extraordinary during the

.10250.26227
great Comunion <date>Aug. 13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1727</date>, and I begged the Lord Jesus,
<hi rend="strikethrough">attended</hi> with many Tears to think also of me. I went here to
School to <persname>Mr. Krumpa</persname>, who often told us that he loved the
Lord Jesus, because he had shed his Blood for us. This excited
in me a Confidence to our Savior that he probably had also
shed his Blood for me, & would have Mercy upon me. At the
Time when in <placename>Herrnhut</placename> the great Awakening among the Children
began, he asked once his Scholars: Whether they also would love
our Savior & give him their Hearts, so that He might wash them
wih his Blood? With those who expressed a Desire for it, he
made a Covenant, to love Him above all Things who loved us
first. Upon which Occasion He in whose Eyes we were precious
walked certainly in our Midst, & none of us knew what had hap,
pened unto us. It occasioned a great Joy in <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, that our 
Savior had also graciously visited the Children in <placename>Berthelsdorf</placename>.
We wept & prayed together during an inexpressible Feeling of the
Nearness of Jesus.
     My Parents moved soon after to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, where we had
it outwardly very pinching & hard. But I must say to the 
Praise of our Savior, that I could suit myself pretty well into
poor Circumstances, for I had left my Mother Country with
no other Intention, than to be satisfied with Bread and Water.
But the H. Ghost begun a new Work in me. I learned to know
our Savior as the Friend of poor Sinners; he forgave me 
the Sin of Not believing in Him and His Merit, & showed me my

[page break]

Name engraven into his Hands. Now happy did my Heart
feel when he cleared it up to me, that His Sufferings, his Death
& Bloodshedding had also happened for my sake, & that I was
his Property. I could not sufficiently contemplate our Savior
in his Sufferings Beauty, whereby all external Troubles &
Difficulties were made quite easy to me. In <date>January 1729</date>
I was to my inexpressible Joy admitted to the H. Comunion
with the Congrn. I then made |: as it was the Custom at that
Time :| a public Confession before the Cogrn. that I would be,
long with Soul & Body to my Redeemer & devote to Him
Life & All. In this blessed Enjoyment of our Savior, I went
on during a particular Care of the never to be forgotten Dis,
ciple of the Lord, <persname>Count Zinzendorf</persname>, who took much Care &
Pain with me, till <date>1732</date> when i came to <placename>Ebersdorf</placename>, to take
Care of some young Countesses. Here I was to my Heart
somewhat removed from the Simplicity in Christ Jesus.
But our Savior, according to his great Faithfulness, did not
suffer me to be plucked out of his Hand, but renewed in me that
Mind to devote myself to him <sic>intirely <corr>entirely</corr></sic>, & to look upon it as my
destined Share to follow him, in Poverty & Reproach. By Occasion
that I was joined in H. Matrimony <date>Sept. 8</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1733</date> with that
Servent of Jesus my late Husband <persname>David Kriegelstein</persname>, I re,
newed the Covenant with our Savior to be his with Soul and Body, and
begged Him to be with me, & lead me by his Hand, till he would
happily take me home. He did not last long, before we had to

.10250.26228
experience Poverty & Reproach of various Kinds. Till <date>1736</date>
we had the Care of the Girls <sic>Oeconomy <corr>Economy</corr></sic> in <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, & assisted in
the Work of the Lord & the Congrn. and particularly the married Choir. 
In <date>June</date><date> the same Year</date><date></date> we went to <placename>Ronneburg in Wetteravia</placename>, &
from there to <placename>Frankfort upon Mayn</placename>, & with these Journies we made
the Beginning of a poor Pilgrim Life, having often at our Nights Lodgings
neither Bed Clothes above nor under us; and in the latter Place,
there arose soon a Persecution against the Brethren, so that we
were obliged to leave the City. We then stayed with the Pilgrim 
Congrn. at <placename>Berlin</placename>, & afterwards in <placename>Wetteravia</placename> till in <date>Oct. 1738</date> when
we sat out on our Journey from <placename>Marienborn to Livonia </placename>with a Visa
to go, agreable to our Call, through Russia to Persia. Our Savior
blessed our Abode in <placename>Livonia</placename> to many Souls, & granted us the Grace
to testify with a hearful Heart to People in high & low Rank
what Jesus Blood each do on Sinners <unclear>base</unclear>. I shall never 
forget it, what a powerful Grace ruled at that Time among
the Estonians & Lettonians. 
     In <date>1740</date> we returned to <placename>Marienborn</placename>, where I enjoyed a very
blessed Time. The Year following |:<date>1741</date>:| we resided with the
Pilgrim Congrn. at Geneva and Montmirail and in <date>May 1742</date> we
went with <persname>Count Zinzendorf</persname>s Family the second Time to <placename>Livonia</placename>.
But we found it this time very different from the Time we had
been there before; because a great Enmity had arisen against
the Brethren & which increased more & more, and in <date>April
1747</date> the Beginning was made to put the Brethren in Prison.

[page break]

The <persname>Brn. Gutslef and Helderhof </persname>were first brought as Pri,
soners to <placename>Petersburg</placename>, and in <date>June</date> following also <persname>Br. Fritshe</persname>
and my Husband. Though there was a very strict Prohibition, that
none of the Brn. & Srs. should be suffered either to leave the Country
or come into it; I ventured it however to travel with my Son 3<unclear>1/2</unclear>
Years old, whom our Savior had given me in <placename>Livonia</placename>, & a Foster
Daughter <persname>Mary Jacob</persname>, to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>. Having no Passport I could not
travel on the public Roads, & as besides this 6000 Russians
had formed a Line from the <placename>River Dina</placename> to the Boundaries |:it being
then War:| there was according to all human Appearance no Probabi,
lity to come through. But our Saviour who was so inexpressibly
near to me at the time when my Husband was taken Prisoner
so that it was as if he spoke personally with me, comforted and sup,
ported me powerfully. I simply followed his Leading, and he brought
me at last through many Dangers, round about Ways, Wildernesses
& Morasses to <placename>Angerm√ºnde</placename><placename> in </placename><placename>Curland</placename> to the <persname>Rev. M. Laskiell</persname>
where I was richly strengthened & refreshed. They also cared for it
that I safely arrived at <placename>K√∂nigsberg</placename>, from whence I was accompanied
to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, where I arrived in <date>Aug. the same Year |:1747:| </date>For
Joy that I was in my dear <placename>Herrnhut</placename>, I forgot for some Time all
my Griefs & Sorrows, and <persname>Count Zinzendorf</persname> took a fatherly Care
of me, so that I would speak fully with him about all my Circum,
stances. However the Grief about my dear Husband, of whom
I would get no Account to be depended upon, returned soon, &
besides this I had many laudy & heavy Hours, so that it was
a Wonder that I was so safely delivered of my Son <persname>John Frederie</persname>

.10250.26229
<date>Jan. 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1748. In Aug. the same Year </date>I moved to <placename>Lindheim</placename>
<placename>in </placename><placename>Wetteravia</placename> to have the Care of the Childrens <sic>Oeconomy <corr>Economy</corr></sic>, where
I had the Pleasure to recieve the first Account to be depended
upon from my dear Husband, by a most affectionate Letter
of his own Handwriting. In <date>1751</date> <persname>Br. Risler</persname> came to <placename>Marien,</placename>
<placename>born</placename><placename> from </placename><placename>Petersburg</placename>, & brought me by Word of Mouth good Ac,
counts of my dear Husband, & offered me to take me along with
him. This Offer I received as out of the Hand of our Savior. And
<date>Aug. 1</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi>. I sat out with him & his dear Wife thither with the Blessing
of <persname>Count Zinzendorf </persname>and the <hi rend="underline">Brn</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Srs</hi>. My four Children I re,
comended to the faithful Heart of Jesus & the Congregation, &
my Heart was then so disposed: I know that I am Jesus Pro,
perty; of his Flesh & of his Bone, & shall remain his eternally
tho' I am very poor and wretched. I go with that Mind to my 
dear Husband to do that which our Savior would have me to
do, and I shall continue sitting at the Feet of Jesus. The <date>29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. </date>
<date>the same Month</date> we arrived at <placename>Petersburg</placename>. But I had to keep
myself at first very still in <persname>Br. Koehlers</persname> House, till he had
procured Leave for me to come to <placename>Petersburg</placename>. Besides this I
grew so sick, that I could not think otherwise, but that I should
depart this Life without having seen my Husband. Add to this
that I could not even let my Husband know anything of my
Trouble, because whatever I wrote to him I had to regulate
so that all might read it, because Leave for my Journey to
<placename>Petersburg</placename> was not yet procured. This was a very hard Trial

[page break]

for me, & yet but a small one in Comparison of those to come.
I spent my sleepless Nights in Conversation with my only Friend,
wetted my Pillows with Tears; Jesus Perplexities, his merit
orious Tears, & nightly Prayers, were of great Service to me,
they strengthened & comforted me, so that I could childlikely
resign myself to him, & believe that if I even should go home
to Him without having seen my Husband, that he however
would be my most faithful & never failing Friend, who knows
best for what Reason he has brought me hither. <persname>Br. & Sr Risler
& Ferbers</persname> visited me as often as possible, & refreshed my
needy Soul, which I shall acknowledge with Gratitude as long as 
I live. I however recovered again & <date>Sept 8</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. |:1751:| </date>being our
Wedding Day, <persname>Br. Koehler</persname> made me the Pleasure & led me in,
cognito with his Family to the Brethren in Prison. This
was indeed a great Joy to see each other again after so long a
Time. In <date>Oct. 1751</date> I obtained at last Leave to move to my
dear Husband, to whom Leave was granted to move with the
<persname>Brn Helterhof & Fritshe |:Gudslef </persname>was already gone to our Savior:|
into the hired House of <persname>Sr. Helterhof</persname>. This was a great Refresh,
ment for my sick & weary Heart. But even this could not come
to pass without Trouble, for there came soon Counter Order
that I should not yet move to my Husband, & I had to live 6
Days with <persname>Br. and Sr Risler</persname> in a private Manner. However we
had afterwards the Pleasure to live together for some Time,
which was effected by the inexpressible Pain <persname>Br. Koehler</persname> took, who
for our sake had to put up with much Vexation & Reproach.

.10250.26230
But our Joy did again not last long, for in <date>May 1752</date> our
Brn had to return again to the Catacombs |: <hi rend="strikethrough">subterrarious</hi> Vaults:|
on account of the Misbehaviors of another Prisoner. We Sisters
viz. <persname>Sr. Helderhof </persname>and I had however Leave to visit & to nurse
them. <date>Nov. 2</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>nd</date></hi>. the same Year they and we came into great Distress
by Water, the Nerva swelling to such a Degree that the Water rose
in the Catacombs up to the half of the Windows, & in our House
so that I stood up to the Belly in Water, & thus had to retire
to the upper Story of the House, without being able to put on
dry Clothes. To my great <sic>Surprize</sic> <corr>Surprise</corr> I continued well & healthy
& the next Morning I could go to the Prisoners, who to save
themselves had got up on the Wall, where they had to continue
2 Nights & one Day in the open Air in great Cold, Snow & Rain.
We brought them & also to other Prisoners some Refreshments to
make them warm; but we could not come to them without great 
Danger of our Lives, the Stream having torn the Bridge leading
to the Fortress in such a Manner that scarce a Soldier ventured
to cross it. Similar Inundations happened <date>the</date><date><date> 6</date></date><hi rend="superscript"><date><date>th</date></date></hi><date>. and </date><date><date>11</date></date><hi rend="superscript"><date><date>th</date></date></hi><date>. of </date><date><date>Nov</date>. </date>
but against which better Precautions were taken.<date> Dec. 30</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi>. we
had again the Joy to obtain Leave to live together;<persname> Secretary Na,</persname>
<persname>bakof </persname>having procured free Lodgings for us in the Suburbs, in
which we could live very comfortably.
    <date> Oct. 3</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>rd</date></hi><date>. 1753 </date>our Savior gave me a little Daughter, & this our
little Fellow Prisoner was baptized by the <persname>Rev. Mr. Buzow</persname>
Minister of the great lutheran Church in <placename>Petersburg</placename>, during a
very blessed Feeling of the near Presence of our Lord. She was

[page break]

called <persname>Johanna Christina</persname>. The Minister recomended her with
particular Affection to the Preservation & Protection of our Savior here
in this strange Country; Many Tears were shed upon this Occasion.
     We lived yet sometime very chearful & in Sickness, & the va,
rious Frights, which never were wanting, were so much the easier
to be born, because we could still live together. But still in the
same Year it pleased our dear Lord to take our faithful Friend
<persname>Secretary Nabakof </persname>out of this World. He believed in Jesus. During the
Direction of his Successor, who did not know us, we were first more
confined, and in the Night of the <date>28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of </date><date>Aug</date>. my Husband and the <persname>Brn</persname>
<persname>Helterhof</persname><persname> & </persname><persname>Fritshe</persname> were fetched & carried away, without knowing
<hi rend="underline">why</hi> & <hi rend="underline">whither</hi>. I myself had to assist in putting my Husband who
was sick unto Death into an open Boat, & see him thus carried away
on the Water in Storm & Rain. We two Sisters spent the Night weeping,
& when the next Morning Enquiry was made of those who had carried
them away, whether they had been brought; we were still more frighted
by fearful Accounts of their Fate. At last we received the joyful
News, that they had been brought to their former Prison, & that we
might visit them. We hastened directly to them, to bring them 
some Refreshments. This proved to be a great Joy to see those
yet alive whom we believed dead. To my great Astonishment
I found my Husband a little better, tho' sometimes so weak, that 
I went away in the Evening with the Thought of having seen him
the last Time. I spoke confidently with our Savior about there
Circumstances, and He convinced me that it was according to His Heart

//missing page? //

.10250.26232
& Mind, that they were Prisoners here in <placename>Petersburg</placename>; my
Husband was also convincedof it, & we encouraged each other
often to be resigned to our Fate, & happy & chearful in the Near,
ness of our dr. Lord, and to have all our Troubles sweetened by
the Converse with Him. Leave was indeed given us to visit the
Brethren in the Day Time as often as we pleased; but there were
always People who made it very difficult, <unclear>you</unclear> often impossible
for us, & thus we got one Fright after another. And besides this
our Savr. took in <date>1755</date> <persname>Sr. Helterhof </persname>to himself, & thus I was quite 
alone in the House with my Child. Not understanding the russian
Language, & being obliged to leave my Child alone in the House,
when I had to go out, & being in continual Danger of a <sic>Sur,
prize</sic> <corr>Surprise </corr>by Robbers; the Brn. & Srs. in <placename>Petersburg</placename> advised me
to make Application to the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> for somebody to assist me, &
I got <persname>Br. Grumberg </persname>who took a most faithful Care of me & my
Child. I had also taken a russian Girl out of Compassion , who got
a Love for our Savior, & when I went out |:for I had to carry to
the Brn. all their Necessaries:| she entertained my Child with Singing
Verses. Once in Winter <date>1757</date> when going over the <placename>River Neva</placename>, the 
Ice broke under me, & the Stream carried me a Piece along,
so that I must have been drowned, if the Eye & Watchman of
Israel had not so faithfully preserved me, But I became very
sickly afterwards. In this Distress I prayed fervently to our
Savior, to grant me the Satisfaction, to nurse the three Prisoners

[page break]

as long as they stood in Need of Care & Nursing in this Vale
of Tears & Trouble, though it should even be done in ever so
great Weakness. And this He has done graciously & helped me
so, that through it seemed sometimes as if the <unclear>Tabernacle</unclear> would
break, the B<hi rend="underline">rn.</hi> suffered however no Want. At this Time I had
a particular Confidence in conversing with our Savior. One of
these Conversations in <date>Oct. 1758 </date>was very imppressive to me, when
I spoke fully with him about my whole Course of Life, & was
richly comforted about all my Mistakes. In <date>Febr. 1759 </date>we were
at last set at Liberty, but ordered to go to Casan. We were 5 in
Number, viz. my Husband, the <persname>B<hi rend="underline">rn.</hi> Helterhof</persname><persname> & </persname><persname>Fritshe</persname> & I & my
Child. On this Journey new Trials came upon us. The Brethren could
not bear the violent Shaking of the Waggons, on the bad Roads &
Causeways, made of round Wood, after sitting so long in Prison, &
they had to suffer much, particularly my Husband, who had always
been weak. Add to this the Fright of being attacked by Robbers on the
other side of <placename>Moscovia</placename>, who most cruelly beat our Guards; he be,
came quite enervated, & a mortal Sickness befel him, so that he
lost his Speech. His Mouth was at were burnt up, & his Tongue
withered, I had not even as much as a Drop of Water to refresh
him. I often begged our Savior to comfort him with his Thirst. Besides
this we saw nothing but inexpressible Difficulties before us. The People
did not like to have any Dealings with us, because we had Soldiers
with us, so that we often did not know, where to get a Morsel to eat,
particularly as it was Lent Season, wherein the Russians are very

.10250.26233
strict. At last we arrived at <placename>Maram</placename><placename> upon the </placename><placename>River Ocke</placename>, where 
we met with more friendly People,who looked upon & loved as par,
ticular good Christians & Children of God, & served as as well as
they could. We felt well among these People, & I believe they will be
counted among those to whom Jesus will say: I was sick and ye
have come to the highest Pitch, for he could not even move his
Tongue, & lay quite speech & senseless. The Creature begun now to
plead with the Creator, & I was quite at a Loss what to think or say, 
when I considered that the Departure of my Husband was so near
at Hand. But then in my greatest Trouble, & when I was at the
Brink of Despair, the loving Heart of Jesus interfered, & set Bounds
to the raging Waves; for our Savior gave Strength to my Husband
that he in some Measure recovered, so that, to my great <sic>Surprize</sic> <corr>Surprise </corr>he 
spoke fully with me about our Course hither to, & particularly about
this Journey, whereas he could not speak one Word before. He said
among the rest: Be not discouraged about these Circumstances; thou
knowest that our Savior already in <date>1738</date> gave Directions, that we
through <placename>Russia</placename> should go to <placename><sic>Assia <corr>Asia</corr></sic></placename>, but the Enemy has thrown some
Obstacles in the Way, so that it was stopt, about which I never could
be satisfied, but now our Savr., with whom I have kept up on un,
interrupted Conexion, amidst my Weaknesses of Soul & Body has
satisfied me about it, by this that the russian Government itself
sends us now thither, so that we however shall see Asia, & sojourn in it.
My great Weakness is a natural Consequence of the great & sudden

[page break]

Alteration of my Way of Life hitherto, & belongs to the final Com,
pletion of my Sufferings. And it is a Grace to me, that also in
Sufferings I am made conformable to my best Friend. Our Savior
well certainly restore my Health so that I shall reach the Place of
our Destination. In <placename>Casan</placename> I shall probably go home to our Savior
but <unclear>thote</unclear> wilt go again to the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. with thy Child, & with all our
Children enjoy there much Goodness & Mercy from our Savr. We
then pursued our Journey & my Husband recovered more & more,
yet I had to care for & nurse him like a Child. At last <date>Apr 27</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>.</date> 
<date>1769</date> we arrived at <placename>Casan</placename>, having been three times in evident
Danger of our Lives, after we had entered the Borders of <placename>Asia</placename>. 
In <placename>Casan</placename> we found it better, than we expected. The People there
showed much Love & Respect to us, and even the Governor himself
behaved very friendly towards us. I often begged our Savior to
give us at least one Soul, where our Testimony of him might
find Entrance, & it was not a small Satisfaction to us, that
we could brave the Labour of the H. Ghost, with some Russians
and Turks. I wept & prayed much both on the Journey & particu,
larly here in behalf of the Inhabitants of this Country, & I must
own, that when I spoke right confidently with our Savior about it, he
gave me a very gracious Look, & the Assurance into my Heart
that a Light will yet spring up in this Country. <date>Nov. 23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>rd</date></hi><date>. 1760</date>
<persname>Br. Fritche</persname> departed this Life happily, & on the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of the following
Month of Dec. </date>my Husband followed him in the 63<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> Year of his Age, &
entered into the Joy of his Lord, & everlasting Freedom & Peace after
a Captivity of more than 13 Years. I mentioned it directly to the Com,

.10250.26234
<persname>mander Plaisin</persname>, who out of Love to my Husband, procured a 
Passport for me from <placename>Petersburg</placename>, that so I might safely come thither.
And though the Roads were very unsafe, & much was heard of robbing
& murdering, I nevertheless ventured it on our Savior, to whose
Care & Protection I had quite anew surrendered myself; and it did 
not come into my Mind that any Evil could happen unto me. And
my Eyes flow with Tears of Gratitude & Abasement, when i consider
how evidently our Savior has cared for me, & what Wonders of
Grace & Mercy he has shewn unto me. Just when I was going to
set out on my Journey & had called upon to accompany me , it was
ordered so, that a Libonian <persname>Captain Durnstern</persname> had to travel the
same Way; he took me gladly into his Company & we set out
<date>Jan. 21</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi><date>. 1761</date> from <placename>Casan</placename>. My taking Leave of <persname>Br. Helterhof</persname>
who of the three captive B<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> alone was left, is known to our
Savior, & not to be expressed in Words. The Captain shewed in
expressible Love & Faithfulness to me & my Child, & more than
once ventured his Life for our sakes particularly <date>Jan. 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi>. when it
had the Appearance as if we should find our Graves in the <placename>River
Wolga</placename>; for the Ice begun to sink, & to get Holes, & some of the
first Sleds fell already in the Water. We could not think of turning
or evading it, for on one Side was already upon Water above the Ice
& on the other was a very steep high Shore. In this Distress came the
Captain through the Water to us, broke off Branches from the Bushes
which grew along the Shore, & covered the Holes with them, & himself
led our Horses over them. And thus with the Help of God, we were de
livered out of this Distress, in which we had been from Noon till towards

[page break]

Midnight. The Captain cared for me & my Child throughout the whole
Journey like a Father, did not only pay all Expences, but let always one
of his Servants stay with us, & when distressing Circumstances occurred 
he himself with some others hastened to our Assistance. He everywhere
gave us out to be his Relations, & took Care of our Things in the best
Manner. I brought my Child very sick of the small Pox to <placename>Mascovia</placename>; but
as the Captain would take me with him as far as <placename>Novograd</placename>. I set out 
with my Child sick as it was, & our Savior prevented all ill Consequences.
But in <placename>Novograd</placename> where our Road parted, the Captain was very un,
easy about me, particularly as he had heard of his Servants, that
my Drivers had evil Designs against me, as soon as we should
be alone. But in this Perplexity, we met quite unexpectedly, & to
our Joy, as russian <persname>Lieutenant of the Guard Milkanoth</persname>, who was
a good Friend of the Captain, & also knew <persname>Br. Koehler</persname> in <placename>Petersburg</placename>
very well, who was also travelling thither. I took Leave of my Bene,
factor with a thankful Heart, and he delivered me to the Lieutenant
as his Relation, & begged him to pay strict Attention to our Things
& Drivers, & not suffer them to stay behind with me, saying: All you
do unto her I shall look upon as done unto myself. The Lieutenant
executed also his Commission in the best Manner, and our Savr. brought us
safe & well to <placename>Petersburg</placename> <date>Febr. 24</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1761</date>. O how glad & thankful was I
to be again among Brn. and Srs. But I met again with Difficulties on
account of my farther Journey, everybody representing it to me 
as impossible to get a Passport. But according to my Custom I re,
comended also this Affair to my dear Lord, & begged him to take it in
Hand himself & execute it. And this he did also to my great Joy &
Abasement, for he directed Matters so, that I got a Passport under

.10250.26235
the Name of the Ambassador of Saxony. Having now rested here a 
little after so many sleepless Nights, Dangers, Troubles & Distress, I
sat out from <placename>Petersburg</placename> by Water, with my little Daughter, whom I had
preserved as a particular Gift with all possible Care & Faithfulness,
accompanied by <persname>Br. Kryman</persname>, <date>May 18th. 1761</date>. The taking Leave of the
Brn. & Srs. here was very painful on both Sides. Towards Evening we
set Sail, but we soon got a Storm, which was against us, & a total
Eclipse of the Moon rendered it quite dark, so that we saw nothing
before us but our Destruction, particularly as our Vessel was
too deeply laden, & the <placename>Neva</placename> being in that Place full of Sand Banks.
We returned in great Danger & sailed again the next Day for
<placename>Cronstadt</placename>. Here I had again new Troubles, but our Savior helped
me thro', & we could now pursue our Voyage without any Hindrance.
I now looked once more at the Land of my Troubles with Tears
in my Eyes, & recomended it to the faithful Heart of Jesus.
     So as the faithful Eye & Watchman of Israel watched hitherto
over me on my Journies, so I experienced it also on my farther
Travels by Sea & Land. It was as if the Arms of my dear Savior
enclosed me around, especially at <placename>L√ºneburg</placename> on the rest of my
Journey. During the Time of our Abode at <placename>L√ºneburg</placename> which lasted 10 Days
there were every Day such violent Storms of Thunder & Lightning as no,
body remembered ever to have seen, but when we sat out the Weather
was fair & pleasant. And tho' that whole District was then sur
rounded with War, we saw nothing of it, & arrived at last <date>July 5</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>.</date>
safe & well at <placename>Herrnhut</placename> to our inexpressible Joy. Ah! what Tears of Joy 

[page break] 

and Thankfulness trickled down my Cheeks that my faithful Savior
brought both me & my Children to the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. I devoted it, & myself
anew to Him as his "Property." Thus far her own Relation.
     Her Heart was filled with Thanks & Praise, that our Savior had
accomplished her ardent Desire to be again in the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> at <placename>Herrn,
hut</placename>, so that she now would enjoy a happy Sabbath in the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>,
& with her Children. <date>July 21</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi>. she moved into the Widows House
& was made Use of as an Assistant, till <date>1764</date> when she moved to
<placename>Marienborn</placename>, & <date>1766</date> to <placename>Zeyst</placename> with the then Directory. In <date>1768</date>
she went to <placename>England</placename> with <persname>Br. & Sr. Boeler & Count Dohnas</persname>, & the Year
following again to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>. In <date>1770</date> she got a Call to go with <persname>Br.</persname>
<persname>and </persname><persname>Sr. de Treyden </persname>to <placename>Curland</placename>, & though she found it hard to leave
<placename>Herrnhut</placename>, she however accepted it with a willing Heart. <persname>Sr. de
Treyden </persname>gives the following Account of the Abode & Service of
our late Sister with them: "We were very thankful to our Savior
that he would give us this, through many heavy Trials approved
of Hand Maid of his to go along with us; both to be a Partaker
of our Joy & of the Troubles which befel us. She assisted us
faithfully with good Advice and actual Help, & proved parti,
cularly a real Comfort & Benefit to me after the Departure 
of my dear Husband. Her cordial & confident <unclear>Connection</unclear> with
our Savior, alleviated all Difficulties to us both. She took a very
near & affectionate Share in all my Circumstances. She experi,

for the Good of the Souls were attended with Blessing, the Fruits

She has shewn inexpressible Faithfulness to me & my Child <unclear>till</unclear>

said directly, that she had spoken fully with our Savior about
her whole Course of Life, & had got the Assurance, that he would
soon take her to himself. She added: Ah how sweetly will it

unto Him; Yet I shall ne'er o'er my Happiness, joy otherwise
<unclear>that</unclear> with a blushing Face. I have not to shew any great
