                  <lb/>Soon in my tender years I feeld the work of
                  <lb/>Grace in my Heart, therefore I often wrote Letters

                  <lb/>nothing greater for me imagine, as to loose my Life
                  <lb/>for our Saviour. Anno <date>1730.</date> I came to <placeName>Saxonia</placeName>

                  <lb/>&amp; in the <sic>Botom</sic>  <corr>Bottom</corr> of my Heart believed nothing more
                  <lb/>at all. Anno <date>1734</date>. I got a Call of <persName>Sr. de Ziegler</persName>
                  <lb/>of <placeName>Renersdorf</placeName>. Here I studied with great eagerness

                  <lb/>the Love of the World conquered me very
                  <lb/>often. I frequently went to <placeName>Strawalde</placeName> to divert
