V. The Single Sist<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <persname>A. Mary Anton</persname>.
The following are her own Words:
I am born the <date>18</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May 1739</date> at <placename>Pilgerruh</placename> in <placename>Holstein</placename>. 
but <unclear>so</unclear> they Congregation emigrated, I came as a <add>little</add> Child to
[?] to<placename> Hhuth</placename>. But Anno <date>1744</date>, my Parents <sic>toock</sic>  took me
along to <placename>Berlin</placename>, which was a great Loss to me, then
I heard & saw there many Things good for nothing for me
& had had not our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. preserved me, I had natural Instincts
& Occasion <add>enough</add> to commit many wicked Things. A.<hi rend="superscript">o </hi><date>1747</date>.
I moved w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Parents from thence to <placename>Bertholdsdorf</placename>,
because the gat yet no Leave to come to<placename> </placename><placename><placename>Hhuth</placename></placename><placename>.</placename> Anno 48
we removed to <placename>Hhuth</placename> & after a short Stay there, to <placename>Hhaag</placename>.
Here I came soon to my great Joy in the Anstalt of
the Children. In the Begin I was very happy, but my
lightminded Temper made the feeling of our Saviour
soon vanishing. Anno 49. the <date>25</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of March</date> I was
received into the Girls Choir but soon observed in the
first Conversation that this meant some Thing more
then they <add>were</add> upright & Sincere & that I could not do.
In this year I came with my Parents to <placename>Ebersdorf</placename> &
served the, but resided very often in my Choir-House.
I was here not long I begun to grow indifferent & came 
by means of a wicked Compagnie in poor Circumstances
& became excomunicated for a time from by the Congregation
till our Saviour bestowed Mercy on me that I could
disclose all my hidden Tricks.
Anno 53 in <date>April</date> I was received into the Congregation.
I was

I was ashamed about this Grace, but by all that I came not
farther then my Heart was not open & secure before God &
Man. I soon came in my former Snares again & begun
to doubt if it would come with me to any Thing at all.
However Anno 54 the <date>24</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Feb.</date> as I toock a walk in 
the Field I <add>accidently</add> fell in a intime Conversation w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
& could discover my whole Heart towards him & so
begged Mercy under many Tears & that he would let
me from This Day experience how good it is w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a
happy Heart <add>to be</add> in the Congregation. By this inter_
cource he was as near to me the as if he was visible.
Anno 1755 the Month of <date>Jan.</date> I came in my Choir-House
as wherefore I loockd out a good while. The first time
I was happy again, but as I disliked to appear
as such a wicked & naughty Siner, then it didn't went
as well as it could; but the Truest Friend of my
Soul whose Patiens persecuted me from my youth, did not
draw back his Hand, wicked as I was. They holy Ghost
licke a true Mother begun his Work anew & showed
to me de deplorable Condition of my wicked Heart
& brought <add>me</add> in the <add>most</add> extreme Distress about myself.
I conversed with my Laboures & revealed my whole
Heart towards her & our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. as the great Friend of
Sinners appeared to me again at in his unspeacable Nearness.
Anno 57.  <date>21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of March</date> I became Canditat to the holy
<sic>Comunion</sic> Communion, & had so happy a Time which I shall never
                                                                                            forget

forgot. I lernt now myself better to know, became a
more intime <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr> with our Saviour & he became
many <sic>Siner</sic>  <corr>Sinner</corr> - Fears before his pierced feet. the <date>14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> May</date> I
was confirmed & the <date>11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> June</date> the blessd day <sic>appeard</sic>  <corr>appeared</corr>
where I was to partake on his holy Body & Blood
here I lost myself & could nothing but weep.
the <date>20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July</date> I receiv<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the blessing into the Single
Sisters Choir & I gave him Heart & Hands to become
his true Soul. Soon after I & four Sisters more
went from here towards <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> & arrived the <date>8</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>
of August</date>, where I had the Pleasure to live into the
Choir-House. Here I enjoyd his happy Nearness as a
poor Sinner, but weep <sic>dayly</sic>  <corr>daily</corr> for Want & <sic>Insuffiency</sic>  <corr>Insufficiency</corr>.
His Grace & Mercy is my only Holdfast, without, I easily
could <add>be</add> come inshared again. My only Desire is to live
as his Property to the Joy of his Heart, & that his holy
<sic>Corps</sic>  <corr>Corpse</corr> & Blood may irradicate all what's unJesuslicke in
my Soul & Body. So far She herself.
However [illegible deletion] unsettled <add>her</add> State of Mind, She was for
all that Sincere & openhearted. Anno <date>1760</date>. Our blessed
Disciple spoke her & from this Time our Saviour settled
her Mind & brought <add>her</add> to a sure foundation.
She has been for a Time <sic>excomunicated</sic>  <corr>excommunicated </corr>from the
holy Sacrament & in this <sic>Intervall</sic>  <corr>Interval</corr> the holy Ghost
had his blessed Work in her & she became solid &
                                                                        certain.

He certain. Her <sic>Happyness</sic>  <corr>Happiess</corr> became more consistent
& She <sic>lernt</sic>  <corr>learned </corr>to know by all her <sic>Insuficiency</sic>  <corr>Insufficiency</corr> &
Sinfulness to keep <sic>closse</sic>  <corr>close</corr> to our Saviour & on
his meritorious Atonement. Hereby She found
herself glad, servitable & in Conversation lovely.
It was a Pleasure to her to serve one of her
Sisters & her <sic>dayly</sic>  <corr>daily</corr> Work in Washing She did w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
all possible Care & diligence. In the last Days
of <date>April</date> She was taken sick on a sudden but 
resisted as much as possible, because of her <unclear>Choci</unclear>-
Feast drawing so near. But a vehement Fever
forced her that She willingly the <date>1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of May</date>
entered the Sixth Room. On her Feastday
was She very happy in her Room & was glad 
to celebrate her approaching <sic>Birthsday</sic>  <corr>Birthday</corr> by this op-
portunitity in this so <unclear>Hill</unclear> & happy Place.
The Watch Word of her Birthday was: <hi rend="underline">Er riss muh
heraus denn er halte Sust zie mir. Was muss
Jesus an mir tr√ºben Herzen lieben?</hi> This was
extraordinary pleasing & comfortable to her.
<sic>Privatly</sic>  <corr>Privately</corr> She hoped if our Saviour by means of
her Sickness would't take <add>her</add> in his eternal Safety,
but this She believed was to great a Luck for
her. By all her Smart She was <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> Silent,
of good <sic>Chear</sic>  <corr>Cheer</corr> & very lovely & thankful to her 
Waiter. The 8th as She expected her Portion by
the holy Sacrament, She <sic>seyhd</sic>  <corr>said</corr> : A! When this
would be be the last & when I to Day were so
                                                              happy

happy to expire on his Breast. How well, how
happy would this be for poor me! But <unclear>eff</unclear> <sic>scarly</sic>  <corr>scarily</corr> She 
had receivd the holt Sacrament, then <add>her</add> to hole Countenance
begun to change & lay without Motion, but inwardly
present to herself; She took no Notice of any Thing;
the formerly so very acceptable Visits of her Sisters, became
now very indifferent to her. Her Heart continually conversd<
w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> her only Friend: She made <add>some</add> Motions w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> her Lips
but nothing could be understood, & between 10 & 11 a
Clock in the Evening her Soul departed to her eternal
Home, after a Sojourning in this World of 24 Years,
wanting one Day.
