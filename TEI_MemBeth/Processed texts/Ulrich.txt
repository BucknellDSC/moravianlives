Account of his Path:
I was born at <hi rend="underline"><placename>M&uuml;nsterm</placename></hi><placename> </placename><hi rend="underline"><placename>S</placename><hi rend="superscript"><placename>t</placename></hi><placename>. gregorien thal</placename></hi><placename>

me <sic>stricktly</sic> <corr>strictly</corr> to reading the Scriptures from my Childhood <abbr>tho</abbr>
I was a Bad Child and often thought if ever I <abbr>inknd</abbr> to be happy
I must become another Person. In my 14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. Year I went the first time
to the Lord Supper. I was <sic>allways</sic> <corr>always</corr> very Uneasy when the time drew
near that I should Communicate and promised Amendment every
time I partook, but still I grew worse and worse. In my 15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi>. Year
my Parents <sic>dyed</sic> <corr>died</corr> and I came to my Brother in Law to learn
the Shoemakers Trade. My time being out, in the Year
<date>1746</date> I <sic>sat</sic> <corr>set</corr> out on my Travels with a firm intention to avoid
all bad Company. I came to <placename>Bussweiler</placename> and <abbr>work&#39;d</abbr> with an
Old Man, was mostly alone, and spent my time in praying
and singing, but not <sic>haveing</sic> <corr>having</corr> strength to withstand my Na=
=tural Corruption, I was <sic>overpowed</sic> <corr>overpowered</corr> by Sin. Which made me so
uneasy, that even my Devotions <abbr>appeard</abbr> Sinful to me and
for 14 Days together I went about as a lost and undone Creature
I had not the heart to acquaint any one of my Condition.
But at length concluded |:as I certainly <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> myself lost:|
to enjoy the World as much as possible for which purpose I
sought out my Old Companions and ran headlong into all
Sin and Wickedness. Thus I spent 7 Years, not without feeling

at times great Uneasiness which <abbr>press&#39;d</abbr> Tears from my Eyes. My
Faithful Saviour followed me and brought me now and then to
beg for Mercy and that He would would work a change in me
<sic>comming</sic> <corr>coming</corr> one time out of a very bad Company I was <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> if
I had not been very Merry? My distress was so great that I could
not return an Answer, just then 2 Children came before the
window and sung: Where is Jesus my beloved and my Friends <add>a</add>
My heart and Eyes presently <abbr>overflow&#39;d</abbr> and I hastend to my Apart
=ment to give my tears vent and felt unspeakably happy
I went on some time in that Sensation but not being quite free
from the World I <abbr>sufferd</abbr> myself to be sometimes drawn away
which brought into a State of Indifferency. Yet our Saviour
did not leave me, but made me so restless that I can say
of a truth I felt Hellish Anguish as all my past Sins pre=
=sented themselves before my Eyes. In this state I thought
I will be patient and let my God do with me as it shall please
him and should I perish before he has Mercy on Me. Then
our dear Saviour convinced me that true saving Faith in
him was wanting. In the greatest concern hereat I went to Bed.
It was to me as tho I was <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> what I would have? Our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr>
Saviour gave me Faith in his bleeding Merrits, and pardoned
me all my Sins. My great Distress was over, my Burthren was
removed it was as <abbr>tho&#39;</abbr> I was born anew and quite freed from
the World. In this Happy Situation I continued some time
and was quite another Man so that my whole Neighbour
=hood <abbr>wonder&#39;d</abbr> thereover. I would fain have told all Men
what I <sic><abbr>injoy&#39;d</abbr></sic><abbr> </abbr><corr><abbr>enjoy&#39;d</abbr></corr> and went too far in that Respect, came into
Self workings and dryness. In this Situation I became acquain
=ted with <abbr>Brn</abbr>, who told me of grace in the Blood of Jesus.

I soon <abbr>conceiv&#39;d</abbr> a great Love for them, all they said was <abbr>yea</abbr> and
amen to me, and I thought if there is Children of God in the World
these are such. From them I first heard of the Congregation
and it ways directly made out to my heart: I belong to that People.
The <date>12</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>. of June 1754</date> I went to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> in Company with
2, Others; and the <date>17</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>.</date> came to dwell in the Choir House
as I had been ruined in the World both Soul and Body, It
was my greatest concern Now to become wholly our Saviours
Property He likewise <abbr>display&#39;d</abbr> his power on my Heart. The
<date>15</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>. of December the same Year</date>, I was <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> into the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr>
which was an unspeakable Blessing to me. I had happy
days for some time, but came off from that happy Sensation
and my Natural high Spirit brought me into a confused Situ=
=ation. When the Holy Spirit would lead me as a Sinner to
Christ, I <abbr>labour&#39;d</abbr> against it, and would fain have made my
=self better than I was which was a trouble to our Saviour
and my <abbr>Brn</abbr>: who were often in concern on my Account.
The <date>first of November 1755</date> I partook the Lord Supper the
first time with the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr> and I felt my soul and Body
Penetrated there with, every time I have partaken this great
Good our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviour has been unspeakably near my heart
in his <abbr>Martyr&#39;d</abbr> form. Yet the true Sinnership was wanting
still, My Misfortune was that I <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> more at my own
wretchedness than to our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviour, which Several times
caused me to stay from the Communion. <abbr>Yea</abbr> it came so far
that I <sic><abbr>sufferrd</abbr></sic><abbr> </abbr><corr><abbr>sufferd</abbr></corr> myself to be tempted by Sin, for which cause I was
shut out from the Communion, but our faithful Saviour gave
me an Open heart, so that I could <sic>apear</sic> <corr>appear</corr> before my Labourers as
I was. <gap></gap>And now my distress being at the <sic>Heigth</sic> <corr>Height</corr> I wept so long
before our Saviour <sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr> he anew had Mercy on me and

.10198.26025
again admitted me to the Holy Sacrament. <gap></gap>Our Saviours faith
=ful care brought me more and more into a happy Path so
that I could go to him with all my Concerns and complain
to him when any thing <abbr>offer&#39;d</abbr> to Disturb my Peace. The <date>17</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>.
of June 1763</date> I had the favour of being admitted a Member of
the <orgname>Hourly Intercessors</orgname> which has been a great Blessing and
futherance to my heart.&quot; <gap></gap>Thus far he wrote his Life
to which we add: <gap></gap>He learnt continually more and more
to commit himself to the Care of the great <sic>Physeician</sic> <corr>Physician</corr> of
Soul and Body as his Patient, and found Sufficient Cause
to thank and Praise him for doing so much for his Soul
This he freely testified to others, and was for some Years
one of the Visitors and keeper of Bands in his Choir as well
as having the care of a Room committed to him. As He was
very <sic>strickt</sic> <corr>strict</corr> in Matters relating to his Heart and the heart of
Jesus, He was the same in all things committed to his care
He was a faithful and Industrious Brother in his <sic>Busness</sic> <corr>Business</corr>
and could scarce be reconciled to it when his Ill Health
<sic>hindred</sic> <corr>hindered</corr> him from following the same which was about
three Years <sic>agon</sic> <corr>ago</corr>, and left nothing undone to recover his
Strength, for which reason in the Year <date>1766</date> He took a Jour=
=ney to the <placename>Ronneberg Bath</placename>, But it did not answer the intent
At his Return he was indeed for a short time <sic>ennabled</sic> <corr>enabled</corr>
to assist in the Shop, but in 3 Months time was obliged to
give it up Having a Complaint in the left Hand which
was obliged to be laid open and was not fully cured
before his Death. <gap></gap>A Disorder in His Neck which he
had been troubled with some Years was at length the means
to his Release which he had long most ardently <abbr>wish&#39;d</abbr> for
He partook the Holy Sacrament in his Sick bed and then
