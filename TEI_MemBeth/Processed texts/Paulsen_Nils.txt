He has left the following<br />
Account of his Path <abbr>thro</abbr> time. &quot;I was born at <placename>Tondern in the<br />
Dutchy of Hollstein</placename> the <date>1</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><date>. of July 1708</date> from the age of 14<br />
My Parents put me out to service. For three Winters together<br />
I <sic>keept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>kept</corr> School for little Children, and Summers I <abbr>work&#39;d</abbr> for<br />
the Farmers. In the Year <date>1729</date> I came to a Village not far<br />
from <placename>Flensburg</placename>, where I <sic>keept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>kept</corr> School 2 Years. From my tender<br />
=est Infancy I frequently felt the drawings of the Holy ghost in<br />
my heart, but did not then understand what it was. Of thines<br />
when I read in the Bible it was plain to me that the lives and<br />
Manners of Christians in our days was not suited to the Bible<br />
and I secretly <abbr>wish&#39;d</abbr> to become a true Christian, such as are<br />
described in Holy Scripture. In the Year <date>1731</date> I was taken into<br />
a Merchants Service at <placename>Flensburg</placename>, and continued there 4 Years.<br />
Hitherto I had lived pretty much in Innocence and Simplicity,<br />
but now I had an <sic>Oppertunity</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Opportunity</corr> to become acquainted with many<br />
sorts of People, and might have easily been drawn into a&nbsp;<br />
worldly and sinful Life, had not an Invisible hand protected<br />
me. At length I was no longer Satisfied to live at <placename>Flensburg</placename><br />
and went to <placename>Coppenhagen</placename> to seek my fortune, <abbr>tho</abbr> I knew not<br />
in what, I should find it, but it <abbr>happen&#39;d</abbr> that I came pre<br />
=sently to a Brewer to learn the <sic>Busness</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Business</corr>, in which I made<br />
so much Progress that in less then 3 years I was able to carry<br />

.10189.25972
along on the <sic>Busness</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Business</corr> myself. But several things making<br />
me not <sic>chuse</sic>&nbsp; <corr>choose</corr> to stay with my Master any longer, I went<br />
to another Brew House, where I carried on the <sic>Busness</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Business</corr> 14 Years.<br />
During this season many things <abbr>offer&#39;d</abbr>, which might have<br />
been a snare to me, and I was often near being drawn into<br />
sin, but Just as I was upon the Point, something <sic>allways</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always</corr><br />
held me back. So that afterwards I have often <abbr>wonderd</abbr> how<br />
it came to pass. My faithful Saviour had something better in<br />
store for me which I now enjoy. In the year <date>1735</date> I was <abbr>awakend</abbr><br />
and went on some years under a great concern for my Salvation,<br />
<abbr>till</abbr> the year <date>1742</date> I had a severe <sic>fitt</sic>&nbsp; <corr>fit</corr> of Illness. Then my Concern<br />
became real, I had no Assurance of my Salvation, and felt nothing<br />
but doubts and Fears. I <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> of God to restore me to my Health, or at<br />
least not to let me <sic>dye</sic>&nbsp; <corr>die</corr>, <abbr>till</abbr> I knew what would become of me. As soon<br />
as I <abbr>recoverd</abbr>, I earnestly thought to amend my life, and gave myself<br />
much trouble, but nothing would do, when I thought had done my best<br />
a Circumstance would happen which quite <abbr>overturn&#39;d</abbr> my Self Righ=<br />
=teous Building. At length in the year <date>1744</date> I became acquainted with<br />
the <abbr>Brn.</abbr> and heard of them, that only in our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviours <sic>Merrits</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Merits</corr><br />
and Wounds, grace and Blessing was to be sought and <abbr>attaind</abbr>.<br />
This was agreeable to me to hear, yet I <abbr>feard</abbr> I was <sic>to</sic>&nbsp; <corr>too</corr> undeserving<br />
to receive it, and that <sic>keept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>kept</corr> me back some time. But our dear <abbr>Sav</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr><br />
did not desist following me, <sic>untill</sic>&nbsp; <corr>until</corr> I gave myself up to him just as<br />
I was, and <abbr>receivd</abbr> the <sic><abbr>offerr&#39;d</abbr></sic><abbr>&nbsp; </abbr><corr><abbr>offer&#39;d</abbr></corr> grace and Salvation gratis. By which<br />
Means my heart was at Peace and I <abbr>obtaind</abbr> the Forgiveness of my<br />
Sins and a Childlike Confidence in our Saviour. And <sic><abbr>alltho</abbr></sic><abbr>&nbsp; </abbr><corr><abbr>altho</abbr></corr> I<br />
afterwards often <abbr>griev&#39;d</abbr> him, yet he never <sic>forsook</sic>&nbsp; <corr>forsaken</corr> me, but <sic>allways</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always&nbsp;</corr><br />
<abbr>pardon&#39;d</abbr> me anew, and gave me to find his gracious Countenance <add>was</add> <abbr>turn&#39;d</abbr><br />
towards me. I became tired of my hard Labour in the Brew House<br />
in which our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Saviour had <abbr>prosperd</abbr> me in temporals greatly,<br />
and left my Abode without knowing rightly what I would under=<br />
=take: At first I thought I would visit my Parents in <placename>Hollstein</placename>, and<br />
childlikely <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> that then, my further Path would be <abbr>shew&#39;d</abbr> me.<br />
Our Saviour <abbr>order&#39;d</abbr> it so, that Just as I was going to <sic>sett</sic>&nbsp; <corr>set</corr> out got <placename>Holl=<br />

The <date>13</date><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi></hi><date>. of August</date> I was admitted to the Holy Sacrament in the Church<br />
at <placename>Berthelsdorf</placename>, which was an unspeakable grace &amp; Blessing to me<br />

Our <abbr>d</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Brother was <abbr>employ&#39;d</abbr> in Many Services in his Choir House<br />
and <abbr>perform&#39;d</abbr> all things committed to him with great care and<br />
<sic>Fidellity</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Fidelity</corr>, Particularly he made it his chief concern diligently to<br />
Oversee and have the care of the Information of those Boys<br />
who was appointed to learn Trades in the <abbr>Brns</abbr> House, which<br />
he continued the Charge of, from the year <date>1755</date> to his happy<br />
End. He took part in Joy and Sorrow with them, and <sic>allway</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always</corr> bore<br />
them on his Heart like a faithful Father. In the year <date>1756</date> he<br />
became a Member of the <orgname>Intercessors Company</orgname>, and in the year<br />
<date>1758</date> a fellow Labourer in his Choir. When the Choir Discipleship<br />
was settled here in <placename>Niesky</placename>, he became one of the Number, and<br />
was this year one of the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi></hi><abbr>.</abbr> Disciples. <gap></gap>Ever since the year<br />
<date>1765</date> He was alms gatherer and Sick Waiter in the <abbr>Brns</abbr> House,<br />
It was a Peculiar Pleasure to him, to <sic>asist</sic>&nbsp; <corr>assist</corr> the poor and the sick,<br />
he made <sic>strickt</sic>&nbsp; <corr>strict</corr> <sic>inquirey</sic>&nbsp; <corr>inquiry</corr> into their Necessities, and our Saviour<br />
<abbr>Prosperd</abbr> all that he undertook-&nbsp; neither did he forget them in his<br />
last will. In general his Walk among us was Patriarchal, and<br />
every One that knew him respected him, as his whole <sic>Cariage</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Carriage</corr><br />
was Edifying. <gap></gap>His Heart was firm and childlikely <abbr>attach&#39;d</abbr> to<br />
our Saviour, and he could not sufficiently express his Joy and<br />
thankfulness for his grace Election. <gap></gap>When he spoke of the Sensations<br />
of his Heart, it was <sic>allways</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always</corr> Sinnerlike &amp; Humble, and often drew<br />
Tears from his Eyes that our Saviour had been so merciful to him,<br />
and his love <gap></gap>was so <sic>difficient</sic>&nbsp; <corr>deficient</corr>. Whenever he thought he had been<br />
too Severe towards any one, he was heartily sorry for it. and his last<br />
Request was: that in his Name the whole Choir, young and old might<br />
be intreated to pardon his failings. <gap></gap>Towards the <date>End of April</date><br />
an increasing Weakness obliged him to take to the Sick Room<br />
yet he took care of his Offices almost <abbr>till</abbr> the last day of his Life.<br />
He saw his approaching End with Joy, for he was ready, &amp; knew<br />
his Lords Mind. The day before his departure the text for the day being<br />
read to him, the antiphon of which was: <hi rend="underline">We follow all, to gladness Hall</hi><br />
He cried out Oh that it may be soon! This his Wish was granted him on<br />
<date>21</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi><date> of October</date> when he fell asleep with the blessing of his Choir aged <unclear>62</unclear><br />
