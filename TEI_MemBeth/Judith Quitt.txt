I. The Widow <persname>Judith Quïtt</persname>.
The following are her own Words, which She left in writing
behind her.
I am born <date>1683 the 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Sept</date>. at <placename>Kunewalde</placename> in <placename>Moravia</placename>.
My Vater <persname>Dav. Shindler</persname> & my Mother have been concerd concern'd
about their Salvation, & so they did whatever they could to
bring me up in a religious Way. In the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year
of my Age, I <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> the first Labour of Grace in my Heart,
but afterwarts  afterwards went to divert myself w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the World, not
without restlessness & Disatisfaction in my Heart.
In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year of Age I <sic>marryed</sic>  <corr>married</corr> & <sic>intented</sic>  <corr>intended</corr> to carry
on with my Husband a pious Life. I indeed <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr> <add>to be</add> confident
towards my Redeemer, who very <sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously </corr>vouchsaved
towards us. We soon get Intelligence of the great Awakening
in <placename>Teshen</placename>, but as our Daughter made a Visit there, She
                                                                              was betrayed

was betrayed & my Husband was for that put in Prison.
However soon as he was set free again, he did't [?]
[?] could for all that not be silent by the Visit of 
Christ.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <persname>David</persname> & the following great Awakening in this Country;
and was by that means imprisoned a second time. I came
in hard Circumstances for his Sake at last I got Bail
& he was set at Liberty again. Now we seriously <sic>intented</sic>  <corr>intended</corr>
to leave our Mother-Country, because we had no rest & to 
follow our B<hi rend="superscript">rrn</hi> which went before us. But as <sic>afterwarts</sic>  <corr>afterwards</corr>
<persname>Melchious Nitshman</persname> with two <sic>familys</sic>  <corr>families</corr> more went away,
such a wild Commotion ensued that we must in half a 
Hours time determine to leave our whole Habitation
for our Souls Sake. I <sic>intented</sic>  <corr>intended</corr> to take some Linen along
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> me, but could not find in haste the key-hole, [?]
[?] flung the key away & went w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Husband & three
Daughters out the Door. Scarce had I left my Habitation
then Heart <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> Rest & Peace, that nothing in this World
would have inticed me to return again. But <unclear>scarly</unclear> we
had pursued our Journey some Miles, we fell in with
8 young Men who brought us in the greatest Distress
& sevel times <sic>tyed</sic>  <corr>tied</corr> us. O in what <sic>Dificulty</sic>  <corr>Difficulty</corr> were we in!
We <sic>knowed</sic>  <corr>knew</corr> what sort of Holes <add>were</add> <unclear>preport</unclear> for us in Prison;
therefore we took refuge to begging & told them the would 
consider our Distress & let us go, They were very hard &
<sic>inmoveable</sic>  <corr>immovable</corr> but at last they said, as we go for our Con-
siences Sake they would let at Liberty. Who was more glad
<sic>then</sic>  <corr>than</corr> we, we <sic>procedeth</sic>  <corr>proceedeth</corr> our Journey w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a more firm Con_
fidence & Faith. At <placename>Schönbrunn</placename>, where our dear <persname>Brother
de Seidliz</persname> had part of his Dominion, we heard the first
                                                               Protestant Pr.

Protestant Preaching en enjoy'd the Love & Goodness of
every Body. This we enjoyed every where, on our Journey
till we at last save arrived at <placename>Bertholsdorf</placename>. We went
the same Day to <placename>Hhuth</placename>, where they was just a building the
Congregation House, the Brethren which was on the Roof
knowd us, came down, saluted us with great Joy & Amazement
that we escapd so happily. But as to the same Time was 
no Employment for us there, then we lived 8 Weeks at
<placename>Bertholsdorf</placename> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <persname>Vater Nitschmann</persname>, but afterwards
the blessed Lady the <persname>Gersdorf</persname> took us under her Care & pro-
vided us a Lodging & Boarding at <placename>Kemniz</placename>. But as our
dear Lady a Year after went to her Saviour, we beggd
by our blessed Disciple for a Place in <placename>Hhuth</placename>. We aquainted
our Lord & the Minister at <placename>Kemniz</placename> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Intention,
But they disuadeth us: saying what we would do
in this <sic>Desart</sic>  <corr>Desert</corr>? & who would give us there our Allimendation?
My Husband <sic>answerd</sic>  <corr>answered</corr>: Our Saviour who nourished
4000 Men in the <sic>Desart</sic>  <corr>Desert</corr>, He hoped will find <sic>Advise</sic>  <corr>Advice</corr>
to bring us there through to. We moved also A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1726</date>
to <placename>Hhuth</placename>, where we found several Trials in the first
Years, & I found out very soon, that the bare
Emigration from <add>my</add> Mother Country, was not enough
to set my Heart at Rest. The fundamental Him:
not to belief on the Son of God & his meritorious
Wounds, was here laid open to me, so that I did't
venture to go to our Lords Supper & thereby lost
the great & blessed <sic>Comunion</sic>  <corr>Communion</corr> the <date>13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> Augs</date> at <placename>Berthols-</placename>

<placename>dorf</placename>. In this Situation I pined a good While, till our
Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> once very graciously <sic>loock</sic>  <corr>look</corr> on comforted &
absolved me from all my Sins & tresspasses & I
experienced the Power of his bloody Redepmtion very
emphatically in my <sic>Hert</sic>  <corr>Heart</corr>: This was the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of March 1728</date>.
After that I enjoyd w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Congregation the first time
the holy <sic>Sacriment</sic>  <corr>Sacrament</corr>. <sic>Afterwarts</sic>  <corr>Afterwards</corr> I came under the
hourly Intercessors, & so by Degrees <add>in</add> Several Employ-
ments in the Congregation, & I could every thing where
I was <sic>apointed</sic>  <corr>appointed</corr> for, execute w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the greatest <sic>Plesure</sic>  <corr>Pleasure</corr>
& willingness of my Heart. After passing 10 Years
in <placename>Hhuth</placename>, my Husband & I got a Call to <placename>Ebersdorf</placename>
as Parents for the Children in the Anstalt there.
After a Stay of 3 Years we came at the <placename>Roneburg</placename>,
& then to <placename>Mborn</placename> & <placename>Hhaag</placename>, every where in the
same Quality. After my dear Husband (w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> whom
I lived 37 Years in a happy & <sic>chearfull</sic>  <corr>cheerful</corr> marriage
State, & had w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> him three Daughters, wherefrom
only one is still alive) A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1742</date> went to our dear
Saviour; then I was <sic>apointed</sic>  <corr>appointed</corr> Labourer with the
<persname>Sister Hofer</persname> by the <sic>Wittows</sic>  <corr>Widows</corr> at <placename>Hhaag</placename>. &
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1746</date> I came hither to <placename>Hhuth</placename> in my Choir_House
to rest myself. Our Saviour like formerly also here
to proved himself the best & most true Friend of my poor
Soul. A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1756 the 23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of March</date> I moved upon our
blessed Disciples <sic>Advise</sic>  <corr>Advice</corr> to <placename>Gnadenfry</placename> & was very sure
that this was the Place where my & eternal true Husband
would finish me to go happy & in Peace in his eternal Joy
