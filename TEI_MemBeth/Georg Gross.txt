Simeon of this Choir 7 Years & maintaineth this
Character with Truth most excellently. He every Year
more simple, clear in his mind, Childlike & happy, so
that every Body could guess his Desire to depart in Peace.
His <sic>Streght</sic>  <corr>Strength</corr> begun to fall short, but his <sic>chearfull</sic>  <corr>cheerful</corr>
Heart & <sic>activ</sic>  <corr>active</corr> Temper caused, that he could do his <sic>Bu_
syness</sic>  <corr>Business</corr> till the <date>27</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Apr.</date> when a <sic>inflamatory</sic>  <corr>inflammatory</corr>
Fever sized on his Breast & brought him to Bed.
In his Sickness he was licke  like a Child, comforted full
of Love & Confidence to our Saviour & his Brethre
& in this Situation expected his happy Disolution.
When a Brother askd him about it he answered: In
a little While." I wait for some Thing still (& this
was the holy Sacrament) From this Time nothing
more could comfort him, as to sit down by his
Bed SIde & sing verses of the Blood & Wounds
of Christ, here he <sic>accompanyed</sic>  <corr>accompanied</corr> as long as he
could move his Tongue. Which he loved best &
which could not be repeated enough to him was:
Ach wär ein jeder Puls ein Dank!
und jeder Athem ein Gesang!
Ach schlüg ein jeder Puls sein Sterben!
Säng jeder Athem sein Erwerben!

tenderly, our dear B.r Johannes galve him this Evening
the Kiss to his last Fare well. He took Adieu by
all his Choir-Brethren & begged <add>to salute</add> every One them in the
tenderest Manner. After that begun he became
quite silent & they expected his Departure every
Moment, but falling in a sweet <sic>Shlumber</sic>  <corr>Slumber</corr> &
