II. The Girl <hi rend="underline"><persname>Agnes Bönish</persname></hi>.
She was <date>1752. the 7</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of July</date> at <placename>New Herrnhuth in Groenland</placename>
born, & <sic>baptised</sic>  <corr>baptized</corr> by <persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Johanes</persname> who was just there, the same time,
In her Childhood she made her Parents as well as the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. &
Sisters there many happy Hours. <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 57. the 25th. of Nov.</date>
<persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. & Sist</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Beck</persname> brought her along to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> & there She came in the
Girls-House. She has been extraordinary lively & <sic>activ</sic>  <corr>active</corr>
& loved the Children very much & so did the Children to
her, not caring that <add>and never <sic>mindet</sic>  <corr>minded</corr> that</add> the could't talk w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. one another
then <persname>Agnes</persname> <add>could</add> not a Word german. But her able nature
made her to <sic>lern</sic>  <corr>learn</corr> the Language very soon & easy, &
was very soon athome amongst the Children.
Her extraordinary Activity was soon forgot &
One could behold in a Short Time on her a tender
& lovely Child towards our Saviour. She very often

entertained her Room-Fellows along while in
telling them, how She would in time say the poor
Greenlanders how well & happy a poor Creature could
become by our Saviour & what She feeled & enjoy'd by
Him. <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1760.</date> Was She taken amongst the rest with the
<sic>shmal</sic>  <corr>small</corr> Pox got afterwards bad Eyes, & as her Eyes
grew better the a hectic-fever took place, but
for all that She was lively & happy & was <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr>
grieved when She must hinder herself from the
Children-Meeting. She was <sic>continualy </sic> <corr>continually</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. her
Children, as much as her Weak Circumstances
would allow it. Her sedate Disposition of Mind
made her so much regard by her Children that
every one submitted to her Remembrances.
Hereby we cann't pass over the Joy we had about
her, when <add>her</add> sickly Circumstances sometimes caused
her some heat or <sic>Impatiens</sic>  <corr>Impatience</corr>, how soon she
judged herself & came directly w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 100 Tears
in her Eyes begging <sic>forgivenes</sic>  <corr>forgiveness</corr>, & we had enough
to do only to comfort her. Shortly before
as <persname>Binel Grass</persname> departed w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. which She had
a very intim <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr>, they were once both
overheard in a very confident <sic>Discours</sic>  <corr>Discourse</corr>: They 
both were glad that they would soon meet by
our Saviour, & <sic>certifyed</sic>  <corr>certified</corr> their tender Love to
one another in such a touching <sic>Maner</sic>  <corr>Manner</corr>, that

the Sisters since that Time retaineth a certain
Impression thereof in their Heart. Her most
<sic>agreable</sic>  <corr>agreeable</corr> Amusement was to sing, & with Singing
She diverted herself in the Ember Week of <add>the</add> Passion
of her dear Lord, that She very often in the Midst
of such a Liturgie was stoppd by the Weakness of
her Body. After Easter She was quite confind to her
Bed, & all probable Signs <sic>arrising</sic>  <corr>arising</corr>, that our dear
Saviour hastened to finish this tender & lovely
little Soul & the <date>5</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of May</date> in the Morning at
9 <sic>a</sic>  <corr>o'</corr> Clock her long wishd & blessed Hour struck &
she departed w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the Blessing of the Congregation
happy & <sic>easly</sic>  <corr>easily</corr> in her 11th. Year of Age.
