               <lb/>The following are her own Words:
               <lb/>I am born the <date>18</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May 1739</date> at <placeName>Pilgerruh</placeName> in <placeName>Holstein</placeName>. 
               <lb/>but <unclear>so</unclear> they Congregation emigrated, I came as a <add>little</add> Child to
               <lb/><del rend="strikethrough">[?]</del> to<placeName> Hhuth</placeName>. But Anno <date>1744</date>, my Parents <sic>toock</sic>  took me
               <lb/>along to <placeName><hi rend="underline" n="red">Berlin</hi></placeName>, which was a great Loss to me, then
               <lb/>I heard &amp; saw there many Things good for nothing for me
               <lb/>&amp; had had not our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. preserved me, I had natural Instincts
               <lb/>&amp; Occasion <add>enough</add> to commit many wicked Things. A.<hi rend="superscript">o </hi><date>1747</date>.
               <lb/>I moved w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Parents from thence to <placeName><hi rend="underline" n="red">Bertholdsdorf</hi></placeName>,
               <lb/>because the gat yet no Leave to come to <placeName><placeName>Hhuth</placeName></placeName>. Anno 48
               <lb/>we removed to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName> &amp; after a short Stay there, to <placeName>Hhaag</placeName>.
               <lb/>Here I came soon to my great Joy in the Anstalt of
               <lb/>the Children. In the Begin I was very happy, but my
               <lb/>lightminded Temper made the feeling of our Saviour
               <lb/>soon vanishing. Anno 49. the <date>25</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of March</date> I was
               <lb/>received into the Girls Choir but soon observed in the
               <lb/>first Conversation that this meant some Thing more
               <lb/>then they <add>were</add> upright &amp; Sincere &amp; that I could not do.
               <lb/>In this year I came with my Parents to <placeName>Ebersdorf</placeName> &amp;
               <lb/>served the, but resided very often in my Choir-House.
               <lb/>I was here not long I begun to grow indifferent &amp; came 
               <lb/>by means of a wicked Compagnie in poor Circumstances
               <lb/>&amp; became excomunicated for a time <del rend="strikethrough">from</del> by the Congregation
               <lb/>till our Saviour bestowed Mercy on me that I could
               <lb/>disclose all my hidden Tricks.

               <lb/>Man. I soon came in my former Snares again &amp; begun
               <lb/>to doubt if it would come with me to any Thing at all.
