In my 7.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of Age My Parents brought me to
<placename>Hhaag</placename> & there I came in the Anstalt, & found myself
here soon at home. I had from Time to Time feelings
in my Heart from our dear Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & the Children Meetings
have been <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> a Blessing for my Heart.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1746</date> I removed w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Parents hither to <placename>Hhuth</placename>
& so came in the Boys Anstalt here. For all I had
in my Children Years many a blessed Impression in
my Heart, but did't take so much Notice of this
began at present when I thought the of thereof to press
many Tears from my Eyes. <sic>Afterwarts</sic>  <corr>Afterwards</corr> I came in
several poor Circumstances. A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1750</date> I w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a great
many Children was receivd among the Boys & the
then came to my Vater to <sic>lern</sic>  <corr>learn</corr> his Business. In the
the Beginning I went on very well, but <sic>afterwarts</sic>  <corr>afterwards</corr>
came in a phlegmatic state, that it would't go in
nothing with me & was not sorry or distressd about
at all. The most tender <sic>Reminicences</sic>  <corr>Reminiscences</corr> of my Brethen
& reproach's I did't mind much; & in <add>this</add> miserable
Condition I went on a good While. At least our
Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> found means himself & show'd to <add>one</add> the unhappy
Condition my Heart was in. Now I <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr> to weep
& to pray he <add>would</add> give me a sincere & open Heart to
him & my Brethren, which he <sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously</corr> complyeth
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>  I was after that receivd the <date>7 Apr. 1753</date>
in the Congregation to the Joy of my Heart.
Now my <sic>Disire</sic>  <corr>Desire</corr> was set upon, that our Saviour
would attain his whole Intention with me. The holy
Ghost <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr> his blessed work in my Heart, but I soon
                                                                                          lost

lost my Course & spoiled 1 whole Year in <sic>a</sic>  <corr>an</corr> indifferent
State towards our Saviour. On <date>New Years Day 1754</date>
I was very perplexed about my poor Condition, & saw
myself no <sic>Advise</sic>  <corr>Advice</corr> or Help for me. In this Situation
I went to one of my dear Labourers & complaind
in my Need w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Fears to him. He comforted me & ad-
vised me to go to our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miserable & <sic>pityable</sic>  <corr>pitiable</corr> I
am, he knoweth he'll help me. Here I <sic>remembred</sic>  <corr>remembered</corr>
what a Blessing it is to be openhearted & sincere, then
my Heart became easy & comforted & I <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr> my
New Year happy & glad. the <date>25</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Jan.</date> I got
Leave to be present by the Comunion on the Boys
Feast & then also the Day following by the Comunion
in the Church at <placename>Bertholsdorf</placename>. This was a great
Blessing for my Heart. On holy Thursday our
Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> graciously bestowed on me that after <add>the</add> forgoing
Pedilavium & Absolution to partake myself on
his holy Flesh & Blood. By this first Enjoyment
of this great Matter I could say nothing, as dear
Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> here I am, go through all my Soul & Body
& spoil every Thing what's not <sic>Siner</sic>  <corr>Sinner</corr> & <sic>Jesuslicke</sic>  <corr>Jesuslike</corr>
in me! The blessed Memory of the happy Choir-Feast, which
the blessed Disciple kept them the Boys has made a deep
Impression in my Heart, which was the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of July 1755</date>.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1756 the 29th of Augs.</date> I was receivd in Single Brethren
Choir, I begg'd to our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for new Grace & Mercy, &
He did't ashame me, but let me not in Want of his Blessings.

A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 1757 the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the preparation - Discourses <sic>deleiverd</sic>  <corr>delivered</corr> by 
our blessed Disciple caused me frequently a Conversation w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
our dear Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & my Brethren, not without many a blessing
& Comfort for my poor Heart. I poor Child must have his
blessed N<sic>earness</sic>  <sic>continualy</sic>  <corr>continually</corr>, or I become dry & without Life.
My Head Concern is: that he may poor Me by Degrees accustom
to a never ceasing Happiness! So far he of Himself.
The following Years he went his Path easy & happy, & about
the Year <date>1761</date>, he <sic>espress'd</sic>  <corr>expressed</corr> himself also: that he many times
in heavy Circumstances wept before our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & pray'd to
him, that his Heart which alone is certain & to <add>be</add> <unclear>depended</unclear>
on without any Doubt, would preserve him till to the
Time, when he can behold him face to face: & so he could
testify that his Redeemer heard his Prayer & consented
above his expectation, wherefore his Heart shall thank &
praise for ever. It was a pleasure to him to serve the
Congregation in the Hall w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> his Music, & he was as
willing in serving by the <sic>Colledge</sic>  <corr>College</corr> of Musicians. In his
Business he did't <sic>lern</sic>  <corr>learn</corr> much, & could therefore found some
<sic>Dificulty</sic>  <corr>Difficulty</corr> to gain his Want, this sometime made <add>brought</add> him in
some Embarrassment. In such a Perplexity a Brother
found him [?] the <date>16</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of this Months</date>, as he was gone on
his Work & <sic>afterwarts</sic>  <corr>afterwards</corr> went in a Corner weeping, that he 
did't better Care in his younger Years! Soon after, he
<sic>complaint</sic>  <corr>complained</corr> he was ill & must lay down by a Pleuresy, <add>&</add> in
some Days the white Rash appeard, but as he <add>came</add> out so very
<sic>eassy</sic>  <corr>easy</corr>, he as well, as th' other Breth.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> believ'd he would hold
                                                                                            it out

a Clock a hard epileptic Attack presumptuously hastens
his Disolution. After this Parxoism was over, he lay quite
silent to the <date>23</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May</date>, when he in the Morning at two
a Clock went home in Peace, under the Blessings of the
Congregat.<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> & his Choir, with this <sic>Vers</sic>  <corr>Verse</corr>: <hi rend="underline">Der Honigseim von
