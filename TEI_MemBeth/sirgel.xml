               <lb/>In my 7.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of Age My Parents brought me to

               <lb/>here soon at home. I had from Time to Time feelings

               <lb/>have been <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> a Blessing for my Heart.
               <lb/>A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1746</date> I removed w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my Parents hither to <placeName>Hhuth</placeName>
               <lb/>&amp; so came in the Boys Anstalt here. For all I had
               <lb/>in my Children Years many a blessed Impression in
               <lb/>my Heart, but did't take so much Notice of this
               <lb/>began at present when I thought <hi rend="strikethrough">the of</hi> thereof to press

               <lb/>came in a phlegmatic state, that it would't go in

      <lb/>testify that his Redeemer heard his Prayer &amp; consented
      <lb/>above his expectation, wherefore his Heart shall thank &amp;
      <lb/>praise for ever. It was a pleasure to him to serve the
