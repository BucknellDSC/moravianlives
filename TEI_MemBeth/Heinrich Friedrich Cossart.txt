III. Our dear Brother <persname>Henry Friedr.
Cossart</persname>.
As he did not write the full Account of  his Life
himself, then we only can aquaint the Congregation
with the following, viz:
I am born (he writes on a Place of himself) the 
<date>20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Apr. 1714</date> at <placename><sic>Francofourt</sic></placename>   <corr>Frankfurt </corr>on the <placename>Oder</placename>,
where my Vater was Fencing Master by the
<sic>Academie</sic>  <corr>Academy</corr> but dyed <date>Anno 1715</date>. He was born at
<placename>Raven in </placename><placename><sic><placename>Normandie</placename></sic></placename>  <corr>Normandy</corr> & left <placename>France</placename> for the Sake
of his Religion, he travelled to the <placename>Isle of Jersey</placename>
                                                                where

.10115.25646
where he <sic>marryed</sic>  <corr>married</corr> my Mother, who by French Parents
was born in <placename>England</placename>.  She died <add>1725</add> at <placename>Pomerswiz</placename> in
<placename>Silesie</placename> by Baron de Frash.
Soon in my tender years I feeld the work of
Grace in my Heart, therefore I often wrote Letters
to our Saviour & bid my Mother to send it by the
Post. I very often prayeth to dear God with many
a Tears, to make me a Martyr, because I could
nothing greater for me imagine, as to loose my Life
for our Saviour. Anno <date>1730.</date> I came to <placename>Saxonia</placename>
& here I lost all the feeling of Grace <add>I had</add> in my poor Heart
again; but for all that behaved like a Gentleman,
& in the <sic>Botom</sic>  <corr>Bottom</corr> of my Heart believed nothing more
at all. Anno <date>1734</date>. I got a Call of <persname>Sr. de Ziegler</persname>
of <placename>Renersdorf</placename>. Here I studied with great eagerness
the Languages, Philosophie & especially Moral;
<persname>Seneka</persname> was my Idol on whom I hung my very
Heart, but this had its intercourses to, then
the Love of the World conquered me very
often. I frequently went to <placename>Strawalde</placename> to divert
myself, but once Curiosity inticed me in 
going home passing by to visit the Church in
<placename>Bertholsdorf</placename>, where <persname>Magister Rothe</persname> just
preached. The Gospel of the Cross of Christ
soon conquered my Heart again & I went
                                                          to see

.10115.25647
to see <persname>M</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Rothe</persname> at his own House, He recomanded
me to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> & I came & got Leave to abide
there.        So far his own Words.
Some Weeks after his Arrival the Brethren sent him to
<placename>F</placename><hi rend="superscript"><placename>r</placename></hi><placename>. de Shweiniz</placename> to instruct his two Lady Daughters
(Our S.<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <persname>Lorel Luedcke</persname> & <persname>Lizel Marshall</persname>) which he
did w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> all possible love & according to his extraordinary
Genius; Thereby he had a happy Time for his own Heart,
but <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> was sorry that he was so soon taken away
from the Care of the Congregation.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1736</date>. He arrived at <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> again & <date>1737 the
19th of Octob.</date> he was confirmed according to the Custom
of the same Time into the Congregat..<hi rend="superscript">n </hi>Soon after he
was sent to <placename>Hermsdorf</placename> as Praeceptor of the young <persname>S.</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r
de Schachmann</persname> with whom he got a Call to <placename>Berlin</placename></hi>
<date>1738</date> to the Pilgrims Congregation. The Month of June
h. a. he was called to come to <placename>Mborn. </placename>& there was <sic>marryed</sic>  <corr>married</corr>
to <persname>S</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>t</persname></hi><persname>. Taillard</persname> (as to his present Widow) he was blessed in
this Marriage State w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 3 Sons & 4 Daughters, which
all are at several Places in the Congregation. Soon
of his Marriage he travelled with his Wife to <placename>Holland</placename>
where they receivd a Comission to visit the<placename> Isle of Man</placename>
& to deliver a Letter of the Disciple to the well-
meaning Bishops there & to make a more near
<sic>Aquaintance</sic>  <corr>Acquantaince</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Him & as Well as to see if
                                                                                           there

there is any Appearance of a Congregation, or at least
some awakened Souls on that Island. They <sic>toock</sic>  <corr>took</corr> their
Route over <placename>Holland</placename> & <placename>London</placename>, but our B<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. fell sick
on his Way by a violent Fever at <placename>Liverpool</placename> where
he was to stay for a Ship. The People there <sic>was</sic>  <corr>were</corr> very
kind towards him. Amongst the rest a Awakened Man
who heard of him, came & said: that he came to
him, upon a <sic>Ordre</sic>  <corr>Order</corr> of God to serve & take Care
upon him, but in the Place he must tell him
to provide for his poor Soul, because of the Danger
he was in. Our Brother very <sic>thanckfull</sic>  <corr>thankful</corr> for his Love,
aquanted him, that in the Point of his Soul he was very
[eassy] & quiet, because he of his being <sic>aquainted</sic>  <corr>acquianted</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.
our Saviour & can keep close to his Wounds & by that
means if he would take him from this World, he was sure
he came in his eternal Safety. This <sic>Joyfull</sic>  <corr>Joyful</corr> Certainty
of our B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. <sic>Happyness</sic>  <corr>Happiness</corr> <sic>toutched</sic>  <corr>touched</corr> the Heart of this Man
in such a Manner that he served him with the 
greatest Pleasure & said: that he preceived, he was 
sent hither for his own best. Our Saviour took this
Opportunity & set the Heart of this Man towards his
slaughtered Person & not long after took him happy
Home. As soon our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. was a little better they set
out for the <placename>Isle of Man</placename>, where the was very friendly
received by the Bishop & 6 Weeks entertained in the
tenderest <sic>Maner</sic>  <corr>Manner</corr> at his own House; <sic>afterwarts</sic>  <corr>afterwards</corr> the 
visited the Isle but found little or nothing of a Work
of God there, they <sic>toock</sic>  <corr>took</corr> their heartyly Leave by the Bishop
                                                                                        and were

and were with a feeling of his true Love dismissed, & 
returned a.c: in the <date>Month of Aug.</date> over <placename>London</placename> to
<placename>Heerendyk</placename>. From thence he was sent to <placename>Roterdam</placename>
to <persname>M</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Blows</persname> Children.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1740</date>. He <sic>accompanyed</sic>  <corr>accompanied</corr>  <persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Gradin</persname> through <placename>France</placename>
on his Journey to <placename>Constantinople</placename>, & by this Opportunity
made himself <sic>aquainted</sic>  <corr>acquainted</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the <sic>Prostestants</sic>  <corr>Protestants</corr> at
<placename>Lion, Nimes, Marsaille</placename> etc which was a great
Hazard to his Life.       In the Time following
he came to <persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Fishers</persname> Children at <placename>Bern</placename> & had
there according to his Inclination many Occurences
to witness the Redemption by the Blood of the
Lamb with very good Effect.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1741</date>. He and his Wife set out for <placename>Geneva</placename> to
the Pilgrims Congregation & on the Road his
Wife was <sic>delieverd</sic>  <corr>delivered</corr> of her second Son. Hujus Anni
he returned to <placename>Marienborn</placename> & from thence got
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1742</date>. a Message to <placename>Berlin</placename> to treat of the
intended Establishment of the Brethren in
<placename>Newshatel</placename>, where to the King most <sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously</corr>
<sic>aggreed</sic>  <corr>agreed</corr>, but some <sic>Dificultys</sic>  <corr>Difficulties</corr> arose by the Classe
of Newshatel. At the End of this year he followed
the Call with his Wife to <placename>Montmirail</placename> to take
Care of the awakened Souls in that Quarter,
which he did with all possible Exactness &
every Weeks did a Journey to <placename>Newshatell</placename>
                                                         to <sic>visite</sic>  <corr>visit</corr>

Books into the French Language, whereof separat
Pieces to the same time have been printed.
Ao. 1744. By the Syrod at <placename>Mborn</placename> He & his Wife were
<sic>apointed</sic>  <corr>appointed</corr> for a Journey into the Dales <add>or <sic>Valleys</sic>  <corr>Vallies</corr></add> of the <placename>Waldensers</placename>
to <sic>loock</sic>  <corr>look</corr> after their Seed or Children how they do. They both
accepted this dangerous Enterprice w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. much Pleasure
& set out from <placename>Montmiraile</placename> the <date>21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of July</date> a.c:
Our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> conducted them <sic>savely</sic>  <corr>safely</corr> over the <sic>fearfull</sic>  <corr>fearful</corr>
Precipices of <placename>Mount St. Bernard</placename>. In the City of
<placename>Aosta</placename> they met two prostestand <sic>Ladys</sic>  <corr>Ladies</corr> (whereof one
lay dangerously ill & had been very much tormented
by the popish Priests to change her Religion) & he
preached her our Saviour & his bloody Attonement
for our Sins, that She resolved the very Day to set
out, & so echapped the Hands of her Prosecutors; but
before She could reach <placename><sic>Geneve</sic>  <corr>Geneva</corr></placename> She <sic>dyed</sic>  <corr>died</corr> on the Road
happy & full of Faith on the redemption of our Lord.
As he arrived at <placename>Farin</placename> our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. deliverd his Recomentation
to the englsh Minister, but he demonstrated to him the
<sic>Impossibilytis</sic>  <corr>Impossibilities</corr> to come by the present <sic>crytical</sic>  <corr>critical</corr> Con-
junctures into the [?] Valleys, & ensur'd him
that when he insist'd for this <add>Time</add> on his <sic>Refolution</sic>  <corr>Revolution</corr>,
he would not only <add>bring</add> himself, but the <orgname>Waldensers</orgname>
so into the utmost Dangers. Nevertheless they
continued their Journey to <placename>Pignerole</placename> and there
waited on <persname>Count de Peruse</persname>, Governor of the Castle
                                                              of this OutPost.

of this Outpost; but he advised them to <sic>bak</sic>  <corr>back</corr> to
<placename>Turin</placename> & get there Leave, & they instead to give
'em Leave, sent them a Order which route they
have to take on their return home again.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1745</date>. Our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. ventured a second time to <sic>visite</sic>  <corr>visit</corr>

by that means visited Li<placename>on</placename>, <placename>Orange</placename>, <placename>Marseille</placename>, <placename>Nimes</placename>
every where of them Places he wittnesses of the 
Power of the Blood of Christ & found <sic>especialy</sic>  <corr>especially</corr> at <placename>Marseille</placename>
& <placename>Nimes</placename> hungry Hearts to hear the Gospel of their
Redemptions which he <sic>deliverd</sic>  <corr>delivered</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. great Freedom.
By this Occassion he had the Pleasure to <sic>met</sic>  <corr>meet</corr> <persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>.

& was to him of real Service. From thence he
proceedeth & was on his Road wonderfully preserved
by our Saviour, then as he was walking in the
dark of Night over a shmal Bridge fell down
a Story high on a whole Bank of Steep Rocks
without any Damage. In the <date>Month of April</date>
left <placename>France</placename> & <sic>carryed</sic>  <corr>carried</corr> on his Journey ove Genua
<placename>Turin</placename> & <placename>Susa</placename> & arrived happily into the <sic>Valleys</sic>  <corr>Vallies</corr>.
He was <sic>aquainted</sic>  <corr>acquainted</corr> that there were about 5000
People in the <sic>Valleys</sic>  <corr>Vallies</corr> & had 13 Preachers among
them, with whom our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. made himself <sic>aquainted</sic>  <corr>acquainted</corr>

Blood & Suffering & so remaineth with them 10 Days.
After that he return'd over the high & rough <placename>Moun_
tain Se Col de la Croix</placename>, who is taken inpassable
& was the same Time covered w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. <sic>Shnow</sic>  <corr>Snow</corr>, never-
theless there was a Watch kept of 40 Men at the very
Top of the Mountain but out Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> caused it, that
they saw neither him or his Guide. On this Top
he prostrated himself in the <sic>Shnow</sic>  <corr>Snow</corr> before our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
towards the <sic>Valleys</sic>  <corr>Vallies</corr> & recomanted them once more
to the Mercy of our Saviour. On the other Side
of the Mountain was again a French Watch, but
went <sic>happely</sic>  <corr>happily</corr> in a near Town where they kept a
Marked; & so our Br. <sic>luckely</sic>  <corr>luckily</corr> passd the Simits
& arrived in <placename>France</placename> again. He witnesseth in <placename>France</placename>
on several Places, but from <placename>Arvies</placename> he was con_
ducted by 4 Soldiers, however they did not deter
him but let him go in Peace, & so he arrived
by way of <placename>Geneve, Lausanne, </placename>after a <sic>thousend</sic>  <corr>thousand</corr>
Dangers happily at <placename>Montmirail</placename> again.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1745</date> he came from <placename>Montmirail</placename> to <placename>Mariendorn</placename>
& was there at the End of the Synod ordained Deacon
of the Brethren Church, & from thence he got a Call
for <placename>England</placename>. He made a tour to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename>, <placename>Silesie</placename>
<placename>Polonie</placename>, where he made a <sic>Visite</sic>  <corr>Visit</corr> to <persname>Bishop Sitkovies</persname>
from thence over <placename>Berlin</placename>, <placename>Hamburg</placename>, <placename>Zeist</placename> to <placename>London</placename>.
Here he was so happy as to negotiate the Pensilvanien_
                                                                              Act.

& other Bishops & preached the Gospel at <placename>St. James</placename>
in French, in the Savoy, German, & in our Chapel
english.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1747</date>. He received a Invitation to the <placename>Synod</placename> at
<placename>Hhaag.</placename> On his Passage our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> again protected him in a
violent Danger, then a french Caper came so near his
Ship & attackd it so warmly that whole Heaps of Balls
flew into it and damaged the Vessel very much, but happily
echappd. The very Year he returnd again w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> his Wife to
<placename>London</placename> from thence they visited the awakened Souls in
North of <placename>England</placename>, <placename>Plymouth</placename>, & <placename>Cornwallis</placename>; In <placename>Exeter</placename>
a old Methodist <add>(conversly called aed Adam)</add> caused a <sic>Mobb</sic>  <corr>Mob</corr> but out B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> by Way
of his pleasing & friendly Disposition sooth'd them again
& by that means obstructed great Misfortunes. In
general this Journey was very dangerous because of
the high Waters. This & the following Year he has
been Agent of the Brethren Unity in <placename>London</placename>, & 
had a great deal of <sic>Busyness</sic>  <corr>Business</corr>. For all he made
a Intercourse & did a Journey to <sic><placename>Irland</placename></sic>  <corr><placename>Ireland</placename></corr>, preachd
preach there the Gospel & visited our good old <sic>Biship</sic>  <corr>Bishop</corr>
of Man a second time. What our dear B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> did
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1749</date> by the Act of Parliament is more <sic>then</sic>  <corr>than</corr>
worth to be <sic>remembred</sic>  <corr>remembered</corr>. His <unclear>indefaticable</unclear>, true &
<sic>Sorrowfull</sic> <corr>Sorrowful</corr> Activity, & the Glad & Willingness w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> which

.10115.25651
heavy & intricate Commissions (but necessary for the
Safety of the Work of our Saviour) by the english Lords,
who very often in the Begin grew impatient, but were
cooled & friendly again by his humble & obliging Temper,
that he at last <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> attaineth the very Point of his
Commission. That a <sic>usefull</sic>  <corr>useful</corr> Tool he was into the Hand of his
Master as well in Church as other weighty Affairs, is <sic>to</sic>  <corr>too</corr>
extensive to describe, but it is no more but reasonable
to be <sic>thanckfull</sic>  <corr>thankful</corr> for him, & not to forget what our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
has done by the Hands of our dear Brother.
In general we must of him: Nothing was <sic>to</sic>  <corr>too</corr> great & heavy
& nothing <sic>to</sic>  <corr>too</corr> mean & poor & well in Church Affairs,
or by Single <sic>Membres</sic>  <corr>Members</corr>, or Friends, or any Person
whatsoever, it was his Pleasure to serve or oblige
them. This his <sic>peculier</sic>  <corr>peculiar</corr> Disposition to help & serve,
& the good Opinion he had by any of every Body, by
whom he only could detect any Thing inclining to
Good, insnared him very often in difficult Consequences.
However if we <sic>loock</sic>  <corr>look</corr> on the Basis on which his Actions
were raised, we find indeed more reason to praise &
admire <sic>then</sic>  <corr>than</corr> to charge this noble character with
a Fault.
A<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. <date>1750</date> He <sic>get</sic>  got <sic>a</sic>  <corr>an</corr> Invitation to the <placename>Synod</placename> in <placename>Barby</placename>

thought he could live till Morning. On all Sign

Others made some Hope of his Recovery, his
Heart thought quite reverse. He was by his

that it was a Heart Pleasure to behold him.
He begged & desireth by every B.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> & Sist.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who
visited him, to love him & think on him
before our dear Saviour. He himself amused
himself w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> his dear & bloody redeemer in
