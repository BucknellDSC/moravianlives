            in Hinter Pomeranie in the Village of Reinfeld</placeName>.
                  <lb/>My Vater was a Tavern Keeper, &amp; brought me up

                  <lb/>there; but he never was contented with me because
                  <lb/>I was not to govern &amp; lernt not much. In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.
                  <lb/>Year of Age my Vater <sic>dyed</sic>  <corr>died</corr>, from this Time I begun

                  <lb/>Head &amp; Heel, &amp; was thereby of good <sic>chear</sic>  <corr>cheer</corr>, except 
                  <lb/>when I was alone I was afraid Gott would <sic>castise</sic> <corr>chastise </corr>
                  <lb/>me, especially when it <sic>thunterd</sic>  <corr>thundered</corr> or hail'd.

                  <lb/>to <placeName>Stargard</placeName>, where I the first of awakened People heard,
                  <lb/>but did't take much Notice. In the same <add>Year</add> I went to
         <placeName>Stettin</placeName> &amp; there came to work by a awakened Master.
                  <lb/>I asked my Master for <persName>Magister Schienmeier</persName>, of whom
                  <lb/>I heard at <placeName>Staregard</placeName> that he tempted <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr>, I went
                  <lb/>to hear him preach, my Master ask me how I <sic>licked</sic>  <corr>liked</corr>

                  <lb/>on the Cross, I <sic>wondert</sic>  <corr>wondered</corr> at it; I opened or shut

                          <lb/>3. Year he was a blessed Labourer in his Choir. This
                          <lb/>Year was a Year of Happiness to him, all Festivals of
                          <lb/>the Congregation was a real Blessing for his Heart.
                          <lb/>About his last Birth-Day the <date>28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of Apr.</date> he expressd
                          <lb/>himself also: he formerly did <sic>belief </sic> <corr>believe</corr> there was more reason
                          <lb/>on such Days to be ashamed as to <sic>rejoyce</sic>  <corr>rejoice</corr> so very
                          <lb/>much; but to Day he could <sic>rejoyce</sic>  <corr>rejoice</corr> from all his
                          <lb/>Heart, because our Saviour has been extraordinary near
                          <lb/>to Him. <date>Last Sunday</date> as he took a Walk with a

                          <lb/>will take me to himself; only was this Wish that

                          <lb/>took Place that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. would take him. By his
