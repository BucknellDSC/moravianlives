Personals of our d.<hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> deceased Brother <hi rend="underline"><persname>George Jacob<br />
Engelbach</persname></hi> who departed to the Joy of his Lord at <placename>Herrnhuth</placename><br />
the <date>12</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>&nbsp;of November 1768</date>. The account he has left behind<br />
is as follows:<br />
Nothing but obedience moves me to give an account of my<br />
Path <sic>thro</sic>&nbsp; <corr>through</corr> this dying Life. I had rather be Unknown and un=<br />
=noticed, to all but that loving heart beyond compare!<br />
to be known to <hi rend="underline">him</hi> is all my wish and desire.<br />
I was born the <date>24</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>&nbsp;of October 1709</date> at <placename>Auenheim</placename> a Village near<br />
the <placename>Rhine</placename>, in which Place my Father was Parson. My Mothers maiden<br />
Name was <persname>Michaelis</persname> and descended from <placename>Polish Lissa</placename>. In the year <date>1711</date><br />
myself and a younger Brother was deprived of our Father in our Tenderesh<br />
Infancy. After 3 years Widdowhood my Mother Married an Intendant of the<br />
Finaces named <del>Aulber</del> <persname><corr>Aulber</corr>&nbsp;</persname>who removed in the year <date>1716</date> to <placename>Bussweiler</placename>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
where he became <sic>Councellor</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Counselor</corr> of the Finaces. Here I was sent to the<br />
Gymnasium where I saw and heard much evil, and as I grew older became<br />
sensible of the Hurt it was to me, myself my own Brother, my Step Brother and<br />
a Relation of ours a <sic>Minesters</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Ministers</corr> Son, soon found out that we was utterly corrupt=<br />
ed children. We 4 <abbr>join&#39;d</abbr> together in a <del>Resolution</del> to give our Hearts to the Lord<br />
Jesus, often we rose before day, went out into the Fields, <sic>kneelt</sic>&nbsp; <corr>knelt</corr> down on our<br />
knees <sic>Weept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Wept</corr> and <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> for better Hearts. As we saw no help for us it came<br />
in our Minds to go into the thickest <sic>Forrest</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Forest</corr> to feed on grass and pray day<br />
and Night, that our poor Souls might be saved; But the severe and cruel<br />
treatment we met with from our Masters shifted every thing. It is true<br />
that from time to time, we often felt anew the drawings of divine grace<br />
and I remember with shame and Bowedness, what my heart felt whenever<br />
I read or heard any thing of our Saviour and his bleeding wounds, that<br />
presently melted my heart and Draw tears from my Eyes; Yet the <hi rend="underline">in=<br />
=dwelling</hi> Evil, and the <hi rend="underline">outward</hi> Descations which surrounded me <abbr>seemd</abbr><br />
to render my Conversion an Impossibility. Therefore I thought I would<br />
trust in the Lords long <abbr>suffring</abbr>; and hope that the Lord Jesus who once<br />
for all had <abbr>suffer&#39;d</abbr> death for me, would not suffer the <sic>Merrits</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Merits</corr> of his<br />
bitter Passion to be lost on me, But would receive me to his

.10186.25960
his Mercy at the End of all Distress, as he did the Penitent Thief. In the<br />
Year <date>1726</date> I was sent to the University at <placename>Strassburg</placename>; In the year <date>1727</date><br />
to <placename>Jena</placename> and <date>1728</date> to <placename>Wittenberg</placename>. Here that Corruption broke loose like<br />
a Deluge, which had hither to been <abbr>restrain&#39;d</abbr> by the Laws Severity,<br />
and I ran blindly into Sin, the wages of which quickly <abbr>follow&#39;d</abbr>; some=<br />
=times I wept and cried to Jesus for deliverance, but Sin became still<br />
more Sinful, till at length I was <sic>litterally</sic>&nbsp; <corr>literally</corr> the express Picture of<br />
the Prodigal Son! and in the Year <date>1730</date> I actually set out for home<br />
with these Thoughts: I will return to my severe Step Father; he may if<br />
he pleases make me his Servant! To such a pass I was come!<br />
Oh thou Merciful Lamb! thou has taken a poor Creature indeed to<br />
thy Mercy! I was immediately put under the care of a Man who<br />
had formerly been our House Preceptor, but was now become Parson<br />
in a Country Village, who continued his usual rigorous treatment of<br />
me. At length I grew weary of the distress which Sin occasioned<br />
humbled myself, and <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> the Lord Jesus for support, would fain<br />
have been converted but knew not where to begin, and to my Sor<br />
=row had no one to Inform me. I came into works, <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> and<br />
wept, yet sin not being brought under <sic>thro</sic>&nbsp; <corr>through</corr> the Blood of Jesus con<br />
=tinued to rage the more in heart. In the year <date>1731</date> I was sent<br />
to the Seminary of the Candidates to the Pastoral Office and was<br />
a Teacher in the Gynmnasium. O that I had but then been ac<br />
=quainted with my Bleeding Redeemer perhaps I should have been<br />
of Service to the Youth under my care as they all loved me.<br />
In the Year <date>1733</date> I <abbr>receivd</abbr> ordination to a Preacher of the <sic>Gosple</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Gospel</corr><br />
and in the Year <date>1734</date> was introduced as Deacon at <placename>Ingweiler</placename><br />
and teacher at <placename>Ripperhweiler</placename>. The office of a Teacher was weighty<br />
to me, I was <sic>truely</sic>&nbsp; <corr>truly</corr> Sensible of my <sic>unworthyness</sic>&nbsp; <corr>unworthiness</corr> and <sic>innability</sic> <corr>inability</corr><br />
knew not which way to turn, <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> frequent and fervently and<br />
yet continued unconverted, was forever Restless wept in private<br />
before the Lord Jesus and <abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> for Mercy; my poor <abbr>distress&#39;d</abbr><br />
heart <abbr>cleav&#39;d</abbr> to him, and nothing was more pleasing to me than<br />
to preach of his Death and bleeding wounds, which I <sic>allways</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always</corr> did<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with<br />
<br />
[page break]<br />
<br />
with great Emotion, well knowing nothing but Jesus blood and wounds<br />
could sanctify&nbsp;me poor wretched and corrupted Man; and I experi=<br />
=enced, that the word of his Suff&#39;rings was thunder which <sic>shoock</sic>&nbsp; <corr>shook</corr><br />
my Soul and the Souls of my hearers. After I had been 16 Weeks at<br />
<placename>Ingweiler</placename>, I <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> a call to <placename>cron=Weissenburg</placename>, I should have gone<br />
thither a year before, but as I was only <abbr>ask&#39;d</abbr> <sic>wether</sic>&nbsp; <corr>whether</corr> I had a Mind<br />
to go there, and was not duely voted I thought I was free to refuse,<br />
and parson <persname>Heinold</persname> came there in my stead. I had rather have<br />
<abbr>stay&#39;d</abbr> in a Mean Village and known to few, but as I <abbr>observ&#39;d</abbr> it was<br />
the Lords will, I concluded to accept the call, <sic>altho</sic>&nbsp; <corr>although</corr> I should follow<br />
my dear Step Brother <hi rend="underline"><persname>Aulbern</persname></hi> to his grave, who had been senior <persname>Aulber</persname><br />
in that city and <abbr>dy&#39;d</abbr> in the Epedemical Fever which then <abbr>rag&#39;d</abbr><br />
there. With the disposition of heart and Mind I went thither in&nbsp;<br />
<date>February 1735</date>. The largeness of the City, the number of Sick and<br />
abundance of Labour I saw prepared for me made me Tremble, and I<br />
shall never forget with what a feeling, and with how many Tears I <sic>entred</sic>&nbsp; <corr>entered</corr><br />
into my office. In <date>April 1756</date> I married my Step <abbr>B.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> <persname>Shillers</persname> <sic>Widdow</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Widow</corr><br />
I knew not how to conduct myself according to our Saviours Mind in a&nbsp;<br />
Married State, notwithstanding we lived cheerful and happy together<br />
in our way, and every Body regarded us as a Happy Pair. In<br />
<date>February 1737</date> our Saviour gave us a Daughter <persname>Marie Margaretta</persname><br />
and 13 Months after took her to himself in the Small Pox. In<br />
the same Year a Neghbouring Doctor of Physick sent me a<br />
Treatise against the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> Hymns. I <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> it <sic>thro</sic>&nbsp; <corr>through</corr> and was for<br />
the first time convinced that <add>such</add> a people existed. At first I thought<br />
these are <persname>Schwenkfields</persname> descendants, if their doctrine is false, it<br />
will evaporate Gods Word, and Luthers doctrine will never be<br />
<abbr>abolish&#39;d</abbr>. But I found so much of Jesus Blood and Wounds in<br />
these Hymns, that I was quite doubtful what to think, yea <add>was</add> quite<br />
confused for I could not remember that I had ever read in Church<br />
History of a People that <sic>keept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>kept</corr> to the word of Jesus Patience.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And<br />

.10186.25961
and as my poor Heart, notwithstanding its Corruption was always&nbsp;<br />
<abbr>soften&#39;d</abbr> and my Eyes swam in Tears whenever I read of Jesus <abbr>Suffring</abbr><br />
for the Sins of the World, I felt the same Emotion at reading these Hymns<br />
and had a desire to hear more of these people, and this I <abbr>obtain&#39;d</abbr><br />
by means of my dear deceased Uncle <sic>Councellor</sic>&nbsp; <persname><corr>Counselor</corr> Engelbach</persname> who<br />
was in <sic>Connexion</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Connection</corr> with the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: I intreated him to send a <abbr>Br</abbr>.<br />
to me and in the year <date>1749</date> Old <persname>Brother Gold</persname> came at My Request<br />
to my House on his Journey <sic>thro</sic>&nbsp; <corr>through</corr> Our City. This Simple Country<br />
Man was a great Blessing to me. He <abbr>look&#39;d</abbr> cheerful and happy, that<br />
I was not, and myself made confidence in Jesus <sic>Merrits</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Merits</corr> would not<br />
stand the Test, nor quiet the uneasiness of my heart. After this<br />
the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: freqeuntly <abbr>calld</abbr> to see me and when they was gone my<br />
Conclusion was I am not like them, I do not know our Saviour.<br />
I wept and <abbr>pray&#39;d</abbr> and <abbr>conferr&#39;d</abbr> with my Colleague <persname>Pastor Reinold</persname> but<br />
<abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> poor comfort, often I <abbr>stretch&#39;d</abbr> myself in the Dust and<br />
<abbr>beg&#39;d</abbr> our Saviour to look graciously on me, but in the Midst<br />
of my groans and Lamentations <add>it was</add> as <sic>tho</sic>&nbsp; <corr>though</corr> a Voice within me said<br />
arise, you are not in Earnest, If I give you Honour, and leave you<br />
in your High Life, then I may be your Saviour of choice, but it<br />
would not suit you to forgo all things for my sake, so as I have<br />
for your sake. I felt the Truth of this Reproach, and must be<br />
Silent. Mean time the uneasiness of my Soul still <abbr>increas&#39;d</abbr><br />
I began to mourn and lament again, but as it <sic>allways</sic>&nbsp; <corr>always</corr> turns<br />
out Fruitless; the Enemy put it in my Mind that I was a&nbsp;<br />
cast away, our Saviour neither would, nor could be Merciful<br />
to such a sinner. This went so far that I was actually be=<br />
=tween Atheism and Desperation. I could no longer Pray<br />
but wherever I <abbr>turn&#39;d</abbr> cried out: Oh Jesu Oh Jesu! The <date>26</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date><br />
of October 1744</date> when my distress <abbr>seemd</abbr> to be at the highest&nbsp;<br />
Pitch, I was reading the French News Paper, and all at once<br />
I was struck with these words which <abbr>seemd</abbr> as <sic>tho</sic>&nbsp; <corr>though</corr> they was<br />
spoke in my heart: canst thou read that, and hast no<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saviour<br />

<br />
[page break]<br />
<br />
This <abbr>shock&#39;d</abbr> me so, that I let the Paper fall out of my Hands and<br />
fell after it to the Earth. I had no utterance for words, but wept<br />
for Mercy, and gave myself <sic>intirely</sic>&nbsp; <corr>entirely</corr> up to our Saviour without<br />
the least limitation, that with me he might do, whats pleasing<br />
in his sight, and from me take <sic>whatere</sic>&nbsp; <corr>whatever</corr> he will, <sic>whatere</sic>&nbsp; <corr>whatever</corr> he<br />
thinks not right. To me it was as <sic>tho</sic>&nbsp; <corr>though</corr> I then <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> permission<br />
to kiss the Prints of the Nails in his sacred Feet! I felt a Di=<br />
=vine assurance of the forgiveness of my Sins, and <add>the</add> covenant I then<br />
made, is still sure and firm, my heart is no longer mine, but His.<br />
I shall not say much of what <abbr>follow&#39;d</abbr> this change. The want of<br />
a true poor Sinner heart often <abbr>caus&#39;d</abbr> me to commit great failings.<br />
The <abbr>Awaken&#39;d</abbr> Souls keeping to me, Brought on <add>me</add> the displeasure of the<br />
School Master, My Colleague, the Mayor of the City and all the Mages=<br />
=tracy of the Lutheran Side, One Honest <sic>Councellor</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Counselor</corr> excepted. The<br />
Process at <placename>Strassburg</placename> <persname>D.</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>&nbsp;Froereisen</persname> would have me <abbr>turn&#39;d</abbr> out of my<br />
Office by the Civil Magistrates, and so it went on, till the year <date>1748</date>.<br />
Mean time our Saviour gave me more <sic>oppertunitys</sic>&nbsp; <corr>opportunities</corr> of becoming acquainted<br />
with the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: and in the year <date>1747</date> I made a 12 days visit at<br />
<placename>Herrnhaag</placename> to my great Blessing. I was soon convinced that I be=<br />
=longed to this People, but how, or when, my dear Saviour would<br />
bring me thither, that I did not dare to Consider on, this I knew;<br />
it must <sic>thro</sic>&nbsp; <corr>through</corr> a Miracle, otherwise it could not come to Pass. After<br />
this Blessed Visitation, the Enemy grew more <sic>inraged</sic>&nbsp; <corr>engraged</corr>, and I became<br />
a detestation to the whole City except the <abbr>Awakend</abbr> Souls; but my<br />
heart was <sic>chearful</sic>&nbsp; <corr>cheerful</corr> and happy, I supplicated and <abbr>obtain&#39;d</abbr> of my<br />
dear Lord a Promise, which was a great Consolation to me. In <date>Au=<br />
=gust 1749</date> my dear Wife took to her Bed, and in this her last Ill=<br />
=ness she felt she was a wretched Sinner, <abbr>begd</abbr> for Mercy and openly<br />
<abbr>confess&#39;d</abbr> she had sought the World more than our Saviour, and<br />
fell asleep with this fervent wish: Shelter my Soul most gra=<br />
=ciously within thy <abbr>open&#39;d</abbr> Side; In the 36 year of her age.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As

.10186.25962
as I <abbr>observ&#39;d</abbr> above, I had <abbr>obtain&#39;d</abbr> a promise from our dear Saviour<br />
that I should come to his People, but that did not come to pass till<br />
the year <date>1756</date>. In the year <date>1751</date> I came to <placename>Treweiler</placename> as Chaplain<br />
and Inspector. Here at length the Hour of my deliverance&nbsp;<br />
struck. I was severly taken to task for my <sic>Conexion</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Connection</corr> with the <abbr>Brns</abbr><br />
<abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> and after several storms I was required to seperate myself<br />
from them, to quit The Herrnhuters Errors, to deny the People of<br />
God and condemn their Doctrine. This I could not do, but chose<br />
rather to bear the Reproach of Christ and was also removed, and<br />
sat out for <placename>Newwied</placename> in the Year <date>1756</date>. Here I became partak-<br />
=er of the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> Grace and the same year attaind to the Parti=<br />
=cipation of the Greatest Good in the Holy Sacrament, with the<br />
<abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> The Next Year I <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> a Call from the Countess to<br />
be her Chaplain and to preach a Sermon every Sunday at<br />
her <sic>Chapple</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Chapel</corr>, which I accepted with the Consent of my <abbr>Brn</abbr>:<br />
and continued in this office <sic>untill</sic>&nbsp; <corr>until</corr> the year <date>1759</date> In which year<br />
I attended the Disciples Household which spent some weeks to<br />
all and Particularly to my great Blessing at <placename>Newwied</placename> and went<br />
with them to <placename>Holland</placename>. Shortly before Christmas I <abbr>returnd</abbr> with the<br />
same hither to <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> and removed into my beloved Choir House<br />
in which during an abode of near 4 years I have had the Happiness<br />
to enjoy Numberless Blessings and <sic>Benifits</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Benefits</corr>.<br />
Thus far his own Words<br />
By reason of the Vacancy at <placename>Berthelsdorff</placename> <abbr>occasion&#39;d</abbr> by the death<br />
of <abbr>Br</abbr>. <persname>Groh</persname>&nbsp;our&nbsp;<abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Brother often <abbr>preach&#39;d</abbr> there with great Blessing<br />
so as he likewise frequently <abbr>Preach&#39;d</abbr> here in <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> on Sundays.<br />
In the Fall of the year <date>1763</date> he <abbr>receiv&#39;d</abbr> a call to preach the <sic>Gosple</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Gospel</corr><br />
at the little church in <placename>Altona</placename> which he cheerfully accepted of from<br />
our Saviours Hands and sat our for that place in <date>September</date>.<br />
His much blessed service in the <sic>Gosple</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Gospel</corr> at that Place our <abbr>Brn</abbr> and<br />
Sisters have heard in the Journals. His Sermons was so much fre=<br />

<br />
being witnesses which prove that his Testimony was attended with Spirit<br />
and power. In the Year <date>1767</date> he visited the Directorey at <placename>Zeyst</placename><br />
where he stayd 2 Months to his great Blessing as he has <abbr>expres&#39;d</abbr> both<br />
verbally and in his Letters. Towards the Latter end of <date>June</date> this year<br />
He came hither with our <abbr>d.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> Lords Approbation for to rest and refresh<br />
himself. He <abbr>enterd</abbr> his Choir House in a weakly state of Body but<br />
with Joy and thankful Tears, moved into his former Chamber, com=<br />
=mended himself to his <abbr>Brns</abbr>: Love and Favour and told them our<br />
Saviour would prepare and soon take him to Rest. He was very<br />
tender and Affectionate and saluted every <abbr>Br</abbr> he saw with much<br />
Love. Often express how happy he was in living among his People<br />
and <sic>injoying</sic>&nbsp; <corr>enjoying</corr> all good things in the Lords House daily. He never<br />
<abbr>miss&#39;d</abbr> the Meetings notwithstanding his weakness often <sic>keept</sic>&nbsp; <corr>kept</corr> the<br />
Morning and Evening Meetings in his Choirs house and spoke tender<br />
Evangelical with such <abbr>Brn</abbr> as he was particularly <sic>accquainted</sic>&nbsp; <corr>acquainted</corr> with<br />
and was Legitamated as a faithful Heart towards our Saviour and<br />
the <abbr>Brn</abbr>. His Heart was devoted to our Saviour, and <abbr>attach&#39;d</abbr> to his<br />
<abbr>Suffrings</abbr> as a poor Sinner, and <abbr>cleav&#39;d</abbr> to him with Body and<br />
Soul. Often this Expression was <sic>dropt</sic>&nbsp; <corr>dropped</corr> from his Lips: Oh that Mer=<br />
=ciful and Long <abbr>Suffring</abbr> heart of Jesus! O that Merciful and long<br />
<abbr>Suffring</abbr> Heart. The <date>8</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>&nbsp;of October</date> he was at the Love feast and<br />
the Holy Sacrament. The next day it <abbr>appeard</abbr> plainer that he<br />
would not continue here much Longer, he set his outward <sic>afairs</sic>&nbsp; <corr>affairs</corr><br />
in order that he might be quite easy in regard to what he should<br />
leave behind him. The <date>10</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi> he joyfully took to his Bed and be-<br />
=gan to speak fervently to our Saviour and said with numberless<br />
Tears: Oh thou most beloved Heart! Merciful Long <abbr>Suffring</abbr> and of<br />
great Goodness and Truth; Oh Lord Jesus how shall I sufficiently<br />
thank thee; I am not worthy of such Love grace and <sic>Benifits</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Benefits</corr><br />
which thou has <abbr>bestow&#39;d</abbr> on me. After a little pause he resumed<br />
his Disourse which had been interrupted by the Floods of Tears<br />
which <abbr>flow&#39;d</abbr> from his Eyes and concluded with this verse Oh<br />
did each Pulse thy Praises beat, each breath my thankfulness repeat.<br />

He spent his time in earnest longing to be with his beloved Jesus<br />
His Memory had been for some time pretty much <abbr>weaken&#39;d</abbr> and he seldom<br />
attended to what was <abbr>talk&#39;d</abbr> off, But when the Discourse <abbr>turn&#39;d</abbr> to heart<br />
Matters, he was presently cheerful and attentive expressing himself in<br />
such a Manner that it was a pleasure to hear him&nbsp; He <abbr>believ&#39;d</abbr> his most<br />
beloved and Faithful Friend would soon call him to his Presence, and<br />
would not take any Medicines: Sayings nothing keeps me and nothing<br />
helps me Yet when he was <sic>perswaded</sic>&nbsp; <corr>persuaded</corr> not to refuse the Application<br />
of Medicines <sic>intirely</sic>&nbsp; <corr>entirely</corr>, then he was childlike and said do what you<br />
will with your poor Engelbach you are good Bretheren, Oh you give<br />
yourselves so much trouble I know it very well and am sorry for it<br />
I will be obedient but you must have a great deal of Patience with<br />
me. Often he <abbr>pour&#39;d</abbr> out his heart before our Saviour and repeated<br />
incessantly this Request&nbsp; Oh take me hearts beloved Saviour there is<br />
nothing between us we understand each other I am ready. After<br />
the <sic>Injoyment</sic>&nbsp; <corr>Enjoyment</corr>&nbsp; of the Holy Sacrament on the <date>5</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi> Instant he<br />
counted the days and hours and <abbr>sigh&#39;d</abbr> in a moving Manner<br />
come dear Saviour come and take me. The Oppression at his<br />
Breast deprived <add>him</add> of the freedom of Speech but he was attentive to<br />
all that <abbr>pass&#39;d</abbr> and made signs and <abbr>smild</abbr> on the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: that<br />
came to see him in which manner he likewise <abbr>express&#39;d</abbr> his<br />
desire to receive the Last Blessing, and with great difficulty<br />
pronounced the words: He hastens! The <date>12</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi> at noon he folded<br />
his Hands and received the Blessing of the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> and his Choir<br />
and God. With the verse: Now let his Mouth Expiring on thy<br />
dear Breast recline &amp;c<hi rend="superscript">a</hi> his Breath <abbr>stopd</abbr> and he fell<br />
sweetly <sic>assleep</sic>&nbsp; <corr>asleep</corr> leaving a fine look on his Countenance<br />
Aged 59 Years 19 days.<br />
