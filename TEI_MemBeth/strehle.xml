               <lb/>&amp; my Father being also sickly, it came very impressiv-

<lb/>into Sin, &amp; became more senseless &amp; lightminded,
   <lb/>yet not without Uneasiness. In <date>1733</date> a great Change
   <lb/>taking Place in the Duchy of <placeName>Wirtemberg</placeName> &amp; the War
   <lb/>commencing, I was measured with a View to become
   <lb/>a Soldier. I came into great Concern &amp; a serious
   <lb/>Consideration whether I should run away or wait
   <lb/>what Turn it would take, &amp; I prayed to God to put
   <lb/>it into my Mind &amp; Thoughts, what Steps to take.
   <lb/>It became clear in my Heart, to be still, &amp; to let
   <lb/>it go as it would, &amp; I got the Assurance that it would
   <lb/>take a glorious Event, if I even should come among 
   <lb/>the Soldiers. I thought: God is <sic>allmighty</sic> <corr>almighty</corr>, omnipre-
   <lb/>sent &amp; all knowing, I will rely on him. In <date>1734</date>
   <lb/>I went sometimes into the Preachings of the <persName>Rev</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>d</persName></hi><persName>. M</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>r</persName></hi><persName>. 
      <lb/><unclear>Preibt</unclear></persName> at <placeName>Breitenholz</placeName>, in which my Heart often was
   <lb/>powerfully laid hold of, so that I could not refrain from
   <lb/>shedding Tears, tho' I was much ashamed to be seen weep-
   <lb/>ing. <date>1735 in March</date> I was obliged to become a Soldier, 
   <lb/>&amp; came into the Imperical Service at <placeName>Treyburg in Breis-
      <lb/>gau</placeName>. I many times went into the Field, because we
   <lb/>were quartered at first in the Villages, wept &amp; prayed
   <lb/>to God not to withdraw his gracious Hand from me, other,
   <lb/>wise I should be lost. I was much infatuated by the
   <lb/><note type="catchword">Spirit</note>

<pb type="double_right"/>

<lb/>Spirit of War, &amp; learned also to play Cards. In
   <lb/><date>January 1736</date> standing Sentinel in the Night from
   <lb/>1 till 3 o' Clock on the Fortifications I kept a Band
   <lb/>with God; for our Savr. I did not know; my last Situ-
   <lb/>ation presented itself before my Eyes. I promised
   <lb/>him, that if I should come again into the Duchy of
   <lb/><placeName>Wirtemberg</placeName>, so that I could hear again the Word of God
   <lb/>&amp; go again to the H. <sic>Comunion</sic> |: for we were in a roman
   <lb/>catholic Place, &amp; had no Preacher in the Army :| I would
   <lb/>begin anew from that <sic>Comunion</sic> <hi rend="underline">to be obedient</hi>, as
   <lb/>it is expressed in a lutheran Prayer Book, &amp; be
   <lb/>converted. This our Savr. took Notice of &amp; kept it
   <lb/>in Mind, tho' I forgot it again. I came still the same
   <lb/>Year among several other Regiments, &amp; on other Places.
   <lb/>I grew also so confused in my Mind, that I fain
   <lb/>would have become an Atheist, if I could have effected
   <lb/>it. But it was always clear in my Heart, that the
   <lb/>Word of God is and abideth Truth, &amp; thou art an un-
   <lb/>fortunate Man, if thou continuest so. Once I in-
   <lb/>tended to devirt to <placeName>France</placeName>, but divine Provi-
   <lb/>dence directed it so, that I came again into the <placeName>Wir-
      <lb/>temberg</placeName> Country to <placeName>Ludwigsburg</placeName>. There I went into

<lb/>the Church on <date>Newyearsday 1737</date>, &amp; inteneded to par-
   <lb/>take again the first Time of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. At the 
   <lb/>Entrance into the Church, it came all at once into
   <lb/>my Mind: What hast thou promised to God in F<placeName>rey-
      <lb/>burg</placeName> on the Fortification-Wall? What, if thou now gavest
   <lb/>him thy Heart? My Heart melted, I begun to weep
   <lb/>&amp; said Yes. Mean while they begun to sing: With
   <lb/>Jesus I begin, with Jesus I'll be speaking &amp; this
   <lb/>made a deep Impression upon me; I was very
   <lb/>attentive in the Preaching, but at the H. Communion
   <lb/>I felt so heavy, that I could not help thinking I had
   <lb/>partook of it for my Condemnation. After divine
   <lb/>Service my Companions persuaded me to go with
   <lb/>them to the Orphan House Church, where a good
   <lb/>Minister was at that Time. I did it, &amp; heard the
   <lb/>loving Heart of Jesus to Sinners described in so
   <lb/>sweet a Manner, that I got a Confidence to Him, &amp;
   <lb/>resolved to keep &amp; give myself <sic>intirely</sic> <corr>entirely </corr>up to him.
   <lb/>I then frequented diligently the Preachings &amp;
   <lb/>Meetings of this Minister, whose Name was <persName>Beckhen</persName>,
   <lb/>till in <date>1738</date> when in his House I learned to know the
   <lb/>first Brn. from the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> &amp; among the rest our

   <lb/>my Heart in his meritorious Life, Suffering &amp; Death,
   <lb/>&amp; how he still intercedes for all poor Sinners, on ac-
   <lb/>count of which my Heart grew at once clear &amp; easy,
   <lb/>&amp; was delivered from all its Fetters. In <date>1739</date> I got
   <lb/>in <placeName>Tübingen</placeName> a printed Pamphlet <add>into my Hands</add> entitled: The right
   <lb/>&amp; straight Way to Life &amp;c. which proved a great Bless,
   <lb/>ing to my Heart. In <date>1740</date> working in <placeName><sic>Studtgard</sic> <corr>Stuttgard</corr></placeName>
   <lb/>among many wild natural People, &amp; being ignorant
   <lb/>of the Sinnerpoint, having also no body to whom
   <lb/>I could discover my Heart, I became dry &amp; came into
   <lb/>new Perplexities; which excited in me a Desire to
   <lb/>come into Fellowship with the B<hi rend="underline">rns</hi>. Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. I resol-
   <lb/>ved thereto &amp; prayed our Savr. to prepare himself the
   <lb/>Way for it. What I asked for was granted, I got Leave
   <lb/>to go on a Visit to <placeName>Herrnhaag</placeName>. I was received heartily
   <lb/>by the Brn. &amp; it being just <sic>Comunion</sic> Day I was ad-
   <lb/>mitted to the Love feast, &amp; had Leave to be a Spectator
   <lb/>at the Lords Supper. I had a thorough Conversation with
   <lb/>the late <persName>Polycarpus Müller</persName>, &amp; came again into the right
   <lb/>Track. I was all the Month of <date>July 1742</date> in <placeName>Herrnhaag</placeName>
