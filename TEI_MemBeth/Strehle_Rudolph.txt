1. Life of our late Br. <hi rend="underline"><persname>Rudolph Strehle</persname>.</hi>
He writes himself: I was born <date>June 29</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1712 </date>
at <placename>Entringen</placename> a Market Town in the Duchy of
<placename>Wirtenberg</placename>. In my tenderest Infancy I had al-
ready a Feeling of our Savr. & liked to learn
Hymns of my Mother which treated of him. From
my 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Year I went to School, & learned with Plea-
sure. In my 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Year my Mother fell deadly sick
& my Father being also sickly, it came very impressiv-
ly into my Mind, that I soon might be a poor Orphan
& come among strange People, I went into the Field
& prayed God with Tears on my Knees, to save my
Soul, <add>in</add> otherwise <add>things</add> he might do with me as he pleased,
Some Days after my Mother departed. Being 16
Years of Age, my Father brought me to <placename>Tubingen</placename>
to learn the Mason Trade, & 6 Weeks after he
also departed this Time. I still retained a Concern
about my Salvation, however by Seduction I fell

.10283.26371
into Sin, & became more senseless & lightminded,
yet not without Uneasiness. In <date>1733</date> a great Change
taking Place in the Duchy of <placename>Wirtemberg</placename> & the War
commencing, I was measured with a View to become
a Soldier. I came into great Concern & a serious
Consideration whether I should run away or wait
what Turn it would take, & I prayed to God to put
it into my Mind & Thoughts, what Steps to take.
It became clear in my Heart, to be still, & to let
it go as it would, & I got the Assurance that it would
take a glorious Event, if I even should come among 
the Soldiers. I thought: God is <sic>allmighty</sic> <corr>almighty</corr>, omnipre-
sent & all knowing, I will rely on him. In <date>1734</date>
I went sometimes into the Preachings of the <persname>Rev</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>d</persname></hi><persname>. M</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. 
<unclear>Preibt</unclear></persname> at <placename>Breitenholz</placename>, in which my Heart often was
powerfully laid hold of, so that I could not refrain from
shedding Tears, tho' I was much ashamed to be seen weep-
ing. <date>1735 in March</date> I was obliged to become a Soldier, 
& came into the Imperical Service at <placename>Treyburg in Breis-
gau</placename>. I many times went into the Field, because we
were quartered at first in the Villages, wept & prayed
to God not to withdraw his gracious Hand from me, other,
wise I should be lost. I was much infatuated by the

[page break]

Spirit of War, & learned also to play Cards. In
<date>January 1736</date> standing Sentinel in the Night from
1 till 3 o' Clock on the Fortifications I kept a Band
with God; for our Savr. I did not know; my last Situ-
ation presented itself before my Eyes. I promised
him, that if I should come again into the Duchy of
<placename>Wirtemberg</placename>, so that I could hear again the Word of God
& go again to the H. <sic>Comunion</sic> |: for we were in a roman
catholic Place, & had no Preacher in the Army :| I would
begin anew from that <sic>Comunion</sic> <hi rend="underline">to be obedient</hi>, as
it is expressed in a lutheran Prayer Book, & be
converted. This our Savr. took Notice of & kept it
in Mind, tho' I forgot it again. I came still the same
Year among several other Regiments, & on other Places.
I grew also so confused in my Mind, that I fain
would have become an Atheist, if I could have effected
it. But it was always clear in my Heart, that the
Word of God is and abideth Truth, & thou art an un-
fortunate Man, if thou continuest so. Once I in-
tended to devirt to <placename>France</placename>, but divine Provi-
dence directed it so, that I came again into the <placename>Wir-
temberg</placename> Country to <placename>Ludwigsburg</placename>. There I went into 

.10283.26372
the Church on <date>Newyearsday 1737</date>, & inteneded to par-
take again the first Time of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. At the 
Entrance into the Church, it came all at once into
my Mind: What hast thou promised to God in F<placename>rey-
burg</placename> on the Fortification-Wall? What, if thou now gavest
him thy Heart? My Heart melted, I begun to weep
& said Yes. Mean while they begun to sing: With
Jesus I begin, with Jesus I'll be speaking & this
made a deep Impression upon me; I was very
attentive in the Preaching, but at the H. Communion
I felt so heavy, that I could not help thinking I had
partook of it for my Condemnation. After divine
Service my Companions persuaded me to go with
them to the Orphan House Church, where a good
Minister was at that Time. I did it, & heard the
loving Heart of Jesus to Sinners described in so
sweet a Manner, that I got a Confidence to Him, &
resolved to keep & give myself <sic>intirely</sic> <corr>entirely </corr>up to him.
I then frequented diligently the Preachings &
Meetings of this Minister, whose Name was <persname>Beckhen</persname>,
till in <date>1738</date> when in his House I learned to know the
first Brn. from the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> & among the rest our

late <persname>Br. Samuel Krause</persname>. <date>Nov. 5</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. this Year</date>
standing Sentinel our Savr. manifested himself to
my Heart in his meritorious Life, Suffering & Death,
& how he still intercedes for all poor Sinners, on ac-
count of which my Heart grew at once clear & easy,
& was delivered from all its Fetters. In <date>1739</date> I got
in <placename>Tübingen</placename> a printed Pamphlet <add>into my Hands</add> entitled: The right
& straight Way to Life &c. which proved a great Bless,
ing to my Heart. In <date>1740</date> working in <placename><sic>Studtgard</sic> <corr>Stuttgard</corr></placename>
among many wild natural People, & being ignorant
of the Sinnerpoint, having also no body to whom
I could discover my Heart, I became dry & came into
new Perplexities; which excited in me a Desire to
come into Fellowship with the B<hi rend="underline">rns</hi>. Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. I resol-
ved thereto & prayed our Savr. to prepare himself the
Way for it. What I asked for was granted, I got Leave
to go on a Visit to <placename>Herrnhaag</placename>. I was received heartily
by the Brn. & it being just <sic>Comunion</sic> Day I was ad-
mitted to the Love feast, & had Leave to be a Spectator
at the Lords Supper. I had a thorough Conversation with
the late <persname>Polycarpus Müller</persname>, & came again into the right
Track. I was all the Month of <date>July 1742</date> in <placename>Herrnhaag</placename>
& in <date>August</date> I returned to <placename>Stuttgard</placename>. I made the

.10283.26373
Covenant with some Awakened, to remain by
the Doctrine of the Merit of Jesus <add>the</add> Blood & Death of
Jesus, & this was the Beginning of the united Flock
in <placename>Stuttgard</placename>, whereto in <date>December</date> came still 7
Brn. After a repeated Visit in the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. I obtai-
ned my Dismission from military Services in <date>Apr.
1744</date> & arrived with the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> in <placename>Herrnhaag</placename> with 
the W. Word: What is accounted foolish by the World
God has chosen & <date>Jan. 7</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 45</date> I was received into
the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi>. at which the Verse: Happy Cong<hi rend="underline">re</hi>gation
whose Robes the Lambs Blood keeps from all De-
filements & was so impressed on my Mind, that
I always rejoiced as often as it was sung in the Con-
gregation. In 1746 <date>Nov. 13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. 1746</date> I was admitted to
the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. which proved a particular Strengthening
to my Heart. <date>1749</date> I got a Call to go to <sic>Pensilvania</sic> <corr>Pennsylvania </corr> 
set out in <date>February</date> with a Company of Brn. by
Way of <placename>Holland & England</placename> & <date>May 12</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>.</date> we arrived safe
& well in <placename>New york</placename> & on the <date>21</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi><date>.</date> in <placename>Bethlehem</placename>. My
Course here is known to the Brn. & Srs. therefore
I will conclude. <gap> </gap>Thus far he himself.

ful & usefully. He was particularly a faithful
& edifying Watchman in the Night for many Years,
& in his advanced Age he often testified how blessed
this Service had been for his Heart, what happy Hour
he had often had in Conversation with our Savr. & what
Proofs of his gracious Protection & Preservation
he has experienced in the Night particularly in the
Indian War. He had a good deal of scriptural
Knowledge, & loved to read edifying Books, but
