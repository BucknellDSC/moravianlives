                  the 29th of March was a blessed Lovefeast after the
                  Burying of Brother Joseph Lingard, for
                  the whole Society. He was born in 1680. in the Parish 
                  of Glossop in the County of Derby . He was brought 
                  in the high Church of Engelland . In 1729 he marryed
                  the present Widdow, and had with her one son and 
                  Daughter (which last lived here in the Choir-House)
                  In.

                  In the great Awakening which happened here round
                  about in the Year 1743. our Brethren and his Wife became
                  concerned to about their happiness. Ao 44 was he
                  first aquainted with the Brethren and as the same year
                  our Brethren Okerthaussen was put in prison for our Saviors.
                  Sake, he and some Brethren more had the Happiness
                  to partake on his reproach of scorn for the Gospel of 
                  Christ. The preachings were kept in his House; but
                  as his Son came of Age he became the Cause, that
                  it must be left. Our Brother was of very few words,
                  not talkative at all; however he loved the Brethren
                  with whom he was assembled so well and dearly, that he
                  very seldom stayed at home, notwithstanding
                  he had above three Miles to walk; and in his last
                  sickness he expressed himself still about? as little 
                  he sometimes understood, what he said or sung, for
                  all that he was a praying to our Savior that he would
                  let him partake on their blessing and this was richly
                  bestowed on him. He once met Brethren Bohler on the Road
                  to Brassington, and brought him the first time about 
                  this Place, whereover, he rejoiced still in this last
                  Days. He visited the Congregation in Fullnek several
                  times and felt a call in his Heart to seek his abode
                  in this Congregation. But this was not sooner
                  performed while he was persuaded by his son, to 
                  give over to him his whole estate, however as soon 
                  as he consented, the son pulled down his dwellinghome
                  that he was forced as it were to seek his shelter at Dukenfield.

                  Dukenfield. Whereover he shortly before his End, declared
                  himself towards his son. I lived above 80 years in this
                  world, and have done nothing better, as my going to
                  Dukenfield; and you never have done anymore good
                  for me: then to pull down my Dwellings. 
                  He came hither as a stranger, with his wife and daughter
                  with a stick in his hand, without knowing where to
                  find a place of his abode; but a brother took him to
                  long in his house, till we could provide a lodging
                  for him. He now was very glad to find for himself under
                  the People of God. To be received into the Blessings of
                  the Congregation he must stay very long, however 1759.
                  he was with his wife and daughter received into the Congregation
                  and 1760 was admitted to our dear Lords Supper. Which
                  he took for his highest treasure in this world. His bodily
                  Constitution was very strong, but since 2 years his strength
                  decreased very remarkable and he begun to pine for
                  his eternal Rest. In his last sickness, he was very 
                  certain that his Desire would be soon fulfilled. 
                  His Patience contented Contemplations has been every
                  Body who saw him to admiration. Every Body 
                  liked to be with him and therefore rather thronged them
                  selves which Brother was to watch him. The Happyness
                  of his Heart spread itself from it so that every Stranger
                  could perceive what our Saviour has done on this old
                  Vater. After he had blessed his Wife and Daughter and recommended 
                  Them

                  expired sweet of early the 26th of March
