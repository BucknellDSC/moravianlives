      <p> Brief Memoir of the Widow
         Sister Anna Rosina Church,
         who departed at Petershall,
         March 12<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>. 1841.
      </p>
      <p>I was born Feb. 2, 1756 at
         Neustadt in Silesia, during a
         very distressing &amp; troublous period.
         My Parents before my birth resisted
         in Lauenburg, but from there
         they were obliged to remove to
         Neustadt, having lost their all,
         by means of a fire, which consum-
         ed the greater part of the town.
         When I was only a few weeks old,
         my Parents were obliged to flee
         with me in the midst of winter,
         by occasion of the following cir-
         cumstance.
      </p>
      <p>The Roman Catholics (for some reason which I do not know) had determined to set
         fire to the town. My Father standing at his door was accosted by two Priests, who
         requested him to hold.

      <p>
         My Father at first had no wish
         to live in a Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>, but during my
         Mother's last illness, having to fetch
         my brother home from a distance,
         &amp; passing through Gnadenfrey, he
         remained there one Sunday, &amp; attend-
         ed the Chapel. During the service it
         was impressed upon his mind, that
         this was the place for him; He there-
         fore determined to oppose it no longer,
         &amp; on his return home, gave my Mother
         no little joy by telling her he would
         now go to the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>. She then sent
         my brother to Gnadenfrey to B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>.
         Cowley, who treated him as his own
         son, &amp; taught him his business.
         After my Mother's departure, my
         Father settled all his affairs, &amp; remov-
         ed to Gnadenfrey, taking me with
         him. I lived in the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r's</sup> house,
         where I spent 6 happy years. I still
         in my old age, can look back with

      <p>
         despised my weak endeavors, but
         has graciously accepted my feeble
         efforts to promote his cause.
      </p>
      <p>I felt much to leave Gnadenberg, &amp;
         all my dear friends there, but par-
         ticularly B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Holische. They went
         several miles on our way to Herrnhut,
         &amp; When they left us, commended us to
         our Lord's gracious leading &amp; protection.
      </p>
      <p>At Herrnhut we were married Oct.
         9. 1706. After our marriage my hus-
         band was ordained, &amp; I was accepted
         an Acolyte at the same meeting.
         Having received the necessary in-
         structions from the U.E.C. &amp; after
         taking an affectionate leave of the
         Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>. at Herrnhut, we set out, accom-
         panied by the prayers &amp; good wishes
         of the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>. Our journey was a
         distressing one. We arrived at Barby
         on the 20<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> having traveled 3 days &amp;
         3 nights in an open wagon in deep
         snow, &amp; frost so intense, that our clothes
         were frozen stiff on our backs.

      <p>         
         This laid the foundation of a
         severe cold, which brought on violent
         Erysipelas. We set out however, again,
         I traveled 5 days &amp; 6 nights without
         intermission, to Wesel. Here I felt
         a considerable degree of fever from
         the effects of the cold.
      </p>
      <p>Our next Stage was Arnheim, where
         we experienced a gracious preservation
         from our Lord. The fore axle of our
         carriage having broken, we were
         dragged several yards close to the
         sloping bank of the city moat, but
         were extricated from our perilous
         situation by the soldiers on duty.
         We rendered heartfelt thanks to our
         Lord for this merciful Preservation.
         From here I arrived at Zeist in a high
         fever, &amp; my right eye quite closed up.
         We rested here from Oct<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> 30<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> till
         Nov<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>, &amp; then through the goodness
         of our Lord were enabled to proceed
         to London, though I had not yet quite
         recovered, &amp; felt much inconvenience
         
      </p>

         from my eye still being closed up.
         Here we spent 3 months enjoying the
         unremitting kindness of the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>
         many of whom had known my hus-
         band from a child.
      </p>
      <p>After much delay, &amp; having once
         been in imminent danger of being
         drowned in following the vessel to
         Gravesend by a boat, we at length,
         on the 14<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup>Feb<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">y</sup> 1787 set sail for
         Jamaica. During most of this voyage,
         we had to experience the truth of that
         declaration, that through much
         tribulation we must follow our Lord.
         This was in some degree owing to the
         circumstances unavoidable in such
         a case. But the chief cause of our
         sufferings arose from the character
         &amp; conduct of our Captain. He had
         made fair promises, but kept none
         of them, nor did he permit us to enjoy
         our stipulated rights. In short, he was
         a man whose heart was an enmity
         with God, &amp; who could not therefore

      <p>
         be expected to favour, or forward
         his cause, or to shew any kindness
         to those engaged in it. This we had
         painfully to experience during our
         voyage of more than 10 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>At length the wished-for moment
         arrived when we saw our destined
         land, but here our trials were not
         ended. We found on enquiry, that
         the ship would have to put into several
         ports, &amp; might be yet some weeks before
         it reached Black River, when we were
         to land. We therefore determined
         to seek some other conveyance, &amp; were
         obliged to hire a canoe to carry us
         round the Island. This part of our
         voyage which lasted 6 days, was both
         perilous, &amp; most fatiguing, but at length
         we reached the place of our destination.
      </p>
      <p>After our arrival, many, &amp; among
         the rest some medical gentlemen,
         expressed their assurance that we
         could not survive the fatigue &amp; ex-
         posure, to drenching rain at night,
         
      </p>

      <p>
         and scorching sun by day, which
         we had undergone. But the Lord had
         determined otherwise. He graciously
         supported my mind under all these
         trials, &amp; gave me the assurance, that
         he would preserve us, though in the
         midst of danger. "Bless the Lord,O
         my Soul, &amp; forget not all his benefits."
      </p>
      <p>We remained in Jamaica about 5
         years. Here we had many heavy
         trials, &amp; much sickness, notwith-
         standing which we should have
         wished to remain longer then, -but
         my dear husband's health impera-
         tively demanding a change of climate,
         we were obliged to return to England.
         In looking over the time spent in
         Jamaica, I see numberless instances
         of my Saviour's long suffering &amp; loving-
         kindness to rejoice over &amp; be thankful
         for, &amp; also many many shortcomings
         of my own to mourn over; but I trust
         that our labors there were not alto-
         gether in vain. Our Lord blessed

      <p>
         them to come, &amp; we had reason to
         hope, that a few see? the heed in good
         ground.
      </p>
      <p>When we first returned to England
         we could not help feeling a little anx-
         ious about our future lot, not knowing
         whether any situation would be open
         for us; but here our Lord mercifully
         provided for our wants. Just before
         we arrived, B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Verney had departed
         at Wyke, &amp; we were appointed to serve
         that Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> as interim. Here we spent
         some truly happy months, to the just
         refreshment of both soul &amp; body.
      </p>
      <p>Our next appointment was to
         Gomersal, where we resided 7 years,
         during which time all our children
         were born, (with the exception of one
         still born son in Jamaica.)
      </p>
      <p>I can truly say that we considered
         these dear children as precious gifts
         from our Lord, &amp; determined from Him
         earliest infancy, to bring them up for
         him, fervently that they might

         be devoted servants &amp; followers of
         Christ. One of our children departed
         here, aged 11 weeks. This was a great
         trial to us, but we were enabled to
         resign her into the Lord's hands, &amp; to
         say with Job, "The Lord gave &amp; the
         Lord hath taken away." The time
         we lived with this dear Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> was
         always remembered by us with grati-
         tude to our Saviour, for the love &amp;
         confidence which we were favored to
         feel from our B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>, &amp; a large cir-
         cle of friends not in connection with
         our church. From Gomersal we re-
         moved to Mirfield. During our stay
         there, the Chapel was built &amp; the
         Boys School commenced. After
         living here 2 1/2 years, we were called
         to serve the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> in Pudsey, where
         we remained 1 1/2 years. From thence
         we went to Ockbrook, &amp; served that
         Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> 2 1/2 years. In Bedford we lived
         4 years. Here we were truly happy,
         &amp; lived in peace &amp; harmony with the

      <p>B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>. The kindness &amp; sympathy
         which they showed us, during the
         illness &amp; at the departure of our Son,
         will always remain deeply impressed
         on my heart. He was indeed a dear
         Son to us, &amp; gave promise of being a
         useful member of our Church.
      </p>
      <p>His amiable disposition gained for
         him the love of all who knew him.
         It was a severe stroke to part with one
         so beloved, but, it was the Lord's doing,
         &amp; he had a right to claim that which
         he had only lent for a season. His age
         was 16 years.
      </p>
      <p>From Bedford we went to Dukinfield,
         &amp; after residing there 1 1/2 years, removed
         to Devonport. The 7 years we lived here
         were a season of trial, but mercy was
         still mixed in our cup; for we enjoyed
         much love &amp; kindness, both from
         members of our flock, &amp; friends not in
         our connection.
      </p>
      <p>The next 4 years were spent in
         serving the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> in Leominster,

         with the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>In 1823 we removed again to
         Ockbrook. After B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Liley's happy
         departure my dear husband was
         appointed one of the Provincial Helpers.
         He accepted this office in simple reli-
         ance on our Saviour's gracious as-
         sistance, &amp; his confidence in our Lord
         was not put to shame.
      </p>
      <p>In 1829 our eldest daughter was
         called to the Mission in Antigua, &amp;
         was married to B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> J. Coleman. My
         fervent prayers frequently ascend to
         the throne of grace for them &amp; their little
         boy born in 1831. May the Lord bless them
         &amp; set them for a blessing.
      </p>
      <p>In Sept. 1836 a complaint from
         which my husband had suffered for
         some years, increased rapidly, &amp; on the
         17<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> the Lord called his redeemed soul
         out of time into eternity. He departed
         gently, confidently trusting that his
         Saviour would receive him in mercy,
         for he felt assured, (according to his own

         words,) that his pardon was sealed
         with the blood of his Lord &amp; God.
      </p>
      <p>The separation from this friend, with
         whom I had lived 50 years within one
         month, was indeed a heavy trial to me,
         but my Lord enabled me to look for-
         ward with joy to the time when we should
         meet in his presence to live with him
         forever. Soon after his departure, I
         removed with my dear daughter Sarah
         to Fulnec, where I still enjoy her love
         &amp; care. I have here also received much
         kindness from the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> &amp; particularly
         from those living in the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> house.
      </p>
      <p>May our Saviour bless &amp; reward them
         for all the love they have shewn to me
         his poor child. In my old age it has
         often towed me down with gratitude
         &amp; humility before our Lord, where I have
         heard from one or another, that my
         dear late husband &amp; myself were re-
         membered in love by the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> in

      <p>
         weaknesses, our labors were owned &amp;
         blessed by our Lord. It is my frequent
         &amp; fervent prayer that our Saviour would
         continue to shower down his blessings
         upon all the Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ns</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>And now in my 84<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year, I feel
         it my greatest privilege to have such
         a friend as my Saviour to turn to
         with all my wants, &amp; am waiting here
         for the time when he will call me home
         to Himself, &amp; suffer me to thank him in
         a happy eternity for all his mercies.
         I would conclude this short review of
         my Lord's dealings with me, in the words
         of one of our verses: -
         
         <br>Thy mercy &amp; thy faithfulness</br>
         <br>Dear Lord are daily new;</br>
         <br>But who can tell them to thy praise,</br>
         <br>Upon a close review.</br>

      <p>
         Thus far her own.
         Our beloved Mother was now looking
         forward to &amp; hoping for a speedy dis-
         mission from her earthly tabernacle,
         but in patient submission to the
         will of God. Her desire was not how-
         ever granted till 2 years after the
         above was written.
      </p>
      <p>Her stay in Fulnecwas but short.
         Her daughter having in the month of
         Dec<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> 1839 received &amp; accepted a proposal
         of marriage from the S. B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup> Joseph Waugh,
         who was appointed assistant Minister
         at Peterhall, she accompanied them
         to that Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> where they arrived on the
         17<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> Jan<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">y</sup>. 1840. At first she seemed
         averse to leavingFulnec, where she
         had hoped to lay down her burdened
         tabernacle, after her labor should be at
         an end. But the thought that her
         beloved daughter's usefulness might
         be hindered by her refusal, made her
         give the subject the most serious con-
         sideration. She was at this time directed
         to a passage of Scripture, which

      <p>
         set her mind at rest, &amp; made her de-
         cide on going with her daughter. It was
         this, Ex.23.20; "Behold I send an Angel
         before thee, to Reep thee in the way, &amp;
         to bring thee into the place which I
         have prepared." Viewing this as an
         intimation of the Divine will on the
         subject, she entered with cheerfulness
         &amp;alacrity on the preparation for the
         journey of 150 miles; nor did she once
         during the three days which in occupied,
         make the slightest complaint of fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>Here in Peterhall she soon felt
         at home, &amp; seemed comfortable &amp;
         happy. No one attended the means
         of grace more regularly, when able to
         do so, &amp; few could more truly appre-
         ciate, or more fully enjoy those means.
         Circumstances prevented the possibility
         of her becoming much acquainted with
         the members of this Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>, but the follow-
         ing will show that she was deeply in-
         terested in their welfare. "I am grieved,"
         said she one day to her Son, "that I can-
         not attend Chapel, &amp; I am sorry thatset her mind at rest, &amp; made her de-

         I cannot visit the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup> &amp; S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> in their
         houses, but our Saviour knows how
         often I have prayed for them, that he
         may give them every needful gift &amp;
         blessing, &amp; He, I am sure, will not put
         my confidence in him to shame."
      </p>
      <p>Our beloved Mother was in the habit
         of saying with respect to herself, "I am
         no longer of any use here below, what
         can I do." We reminded her that she
         could still in her retirement from
         active service, pray to the Lord on our
         behalf &amp; that of others. "Oh yes," she said,
         "I always remember you all." It was
         evident from many things that her
         prayers were not confined to us, they em-
         braced the whole human race, the
         whole Church of God on earth. But,
         being most firmly attached to the Church
         of the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rn</sup>, when the Lord had mani-
         fested Himself in a saving manner
         to her soul, &amp; in which she had spent
         50 years in active service, it is no
         wonder that the cause of God there was
         most frequently the theme of her

         conversation, &amp; the subject of her
         prayers. There was one department
         of our Church, in which she felt, till
         the last, the strongest interest; the
         Missionary field - Jamaica in
         particular. She never ceased to re-
         member &amp; to love the Black popula-
         tion there. The very mention of
         the Island was sufficient to call forth
         all her energies. At such times a
         ray of holy joy &amp; delight would light
         up her countenance, &amp; it was to her
         as if living over again those days
         long passed away. Oh what songs
         in highest strain - will theransomed
         sing in heaven - With thanksgving &amp;e.
      </p>
      <p>She was in general favored with
         good health, &amp; was delighted to feel
         that she could make herself useful.
         The hope was cherished, that though
         already far advanced in years, she
         might still be spared some time
         longer. She begged however, on this
         being mentioned, that no one might
         pray for her continuance in life, as

      <p>she desired to depart. The fulfil-
         ment of this desire was nearer than
         any of us supposed. The last winter
         tried her much, especially during the
         intense frost. Her cough &amp; general
         weakness increased towards the mid-
         dle of Feb<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">y</sup>, still there was nothing cal-
         culated to alarm her relatives, - but
         from this time she gradually grew
         worse, &amp; was sometimes confined to
         her room. On Sunday the 7<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of March,
         she found herself unable to rise from
         bed. She had thought much of the
         subject of the Holy Com<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>; &amp; the day
         before said, "How sweet it would be
         to go &amp; keep the Communion tomorrow
         with our Saviour"! At her own request
         the Com<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> was administered to her
         by B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">r</sup>. Seifferth, who solemnly com-
         mended her in prayer to the Lord
         with reference to her departure, now
         apparently approaching. On Tuesday
         the 9<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> she seemed considerably better
         &amp; on Wednesday sat up for some time,
         but on Thursday she felt much worse;

      <p>           
         or as the subject of particular reflections.
         She loved to hear verses repeated from
         our Hymnbook, &amp; seemed to derive
         especial comfort from a hymn re-
         peated to her just after she had been
         crying out - "Dear Lord, how long"; -
         &amp; such expressions. It was this:
         "Lord my times are in thy hand" &amp;e
         On the day previous to her departure,
         there was an evident change in her
         manner. She had always been affec-
         tionate &amp; kind, towards her children,
         but now seemed doubly so, holding
         out her hand &amp; looking to kindly
         at them as they came into her room.
      </p>
      <p>On the 12<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> she felt feverish &amp; listless,
         her hands &amp; feet were much swollen
         &amp; her face flushed, but her mind
         perfectly clear &amp; collected.
         Perceiving how much she suffered
         from difficulty of breathing, her Son
         reminded her of the Apostle's words,
         "Our light affliction" &amp;e - &amp; Said he hoped
         her mind was fixed on the unsure
         things of another world.

         "Yes," she replied, "when my weakness
         suffers me to think; but I am well
         assured of His faithfulness." About
         half an hour after this, she requested
         to be helped up, &amp; placed in her chair,
         that she might feel the rays of the sun,
         then shining brightly in at her window.
         She sat about a quarter of an hour,
         saying the sun was warm &amp; pleasant.
         She then returned to bed, but as she
         was settling herself in bed, her daugh-
         ter observed that her head sunk down
         a little, &amp; on looking more closely at
         her, perceived that her eyes were
         fixed in death. She still continued
         to breathe for a minute, &amp; then de-
         parted in the gentlest manner,
         the only difference in her appearance
         being, that no motion was perceptible.
         Her redeemed soul had gone to the
         arms of her Saviour.
         Much might be said as to the
         character of our beloved relative, as
         a wife, a mother, a friend, a Christian, -

         and we should feel it difficult to
         convey to others the sense which we
         entertain of her worth in all these
         characters. But on this subject
         we cannot even enter, being prohibited
         by her own express &amp; reiterated desire.
         We can only say that we cherish her
         memory with the deepest affection
         &amp; veneration; that we bless the Lord
         for the grace bestowed upon her, &amp;
         exemplified in her public &amp; private
         capacity; &amp; that while thankful
         for the example she has set us, we
         have often prayed that a double
         portion of her spirit might rest upon
         us. Her record was on high, &amp; we
         humbly yet confidently [?] she
         was received then with the com-
         mendation - "Well done, good &amp;

      <p>Her own expression in relation
         to this, shortly before her departure
         was: Here is a sinner, who would fain
         Through the Lamb's ransom entrance
         gain! -
