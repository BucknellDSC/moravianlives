               <lb/>I was born <date>July 10th 1713</date> at <placeName>Zauchtenthal near Fulneck
                  <lb/>in Moravia</placeName>. Already in my second Year I experienced a grac-
               <lb/>ious Preservation of God. My Mother used to gather Grass
               <lb/>for her Cattle, &amp; generally took me along, &amp; laying me once down 
               <lb/>near a Tree, a Wolf came, placed himself close by me, &amp; smelt
               <lb/>at me. My Mother felt at once very anxious, &amp; turning
               <lb/>about to look for me, she saw the ravenous Beast with me.
               <lb/>She then run hastily towards me, and the Wolf went a few
               <lb/>Steps back, so that she could take me. My Parents reveiwed 
               <lb/>me anew as a Gift of God, and thanked him with Tears for
               <lb/>my Preservation, for they were both devout People; and 
               <lb/>having looked upon me from my Birth as a gracious Gift
               <lb/>of God, they endeavoured to educate me according to his
               <lb/>Mind, wept &amp; prayed often to God in my Behalf &amp; took
               <lb/>all possible Pains with me. In my 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I became
               <lb/>much concerned about regaining a Fellowship with God 
               <lb/>through Jesus Christ, because I had heard my Father
               <lb/>say, that we had lost it by the Fall of Adam, but that
               <lb/>the second Adam Jesus Christ had procured it again
               <lb/>through his Sufferings and Death. The Holy Ghost took

                  <lb/>up in my a Confidence to God, so that I could converse
                  <lb/>with him quite familiarly, &amp; preserved me in many Dan, 
                  <lb/>gers from Deviations, giving me an Admonition when 
                  <lb/>I was not on the right Track. He at the same time wrought 
                  <lb/>in me a Fear of falling into Sin, and granted me the 
                  <lb/>Grace to speak uprightly with my Parents about every
                  <lb/>Thing. By which means I escaped many Temptations

                  <lb/>In the Year <date>1724</date> there was a great Awakening among
                  <lb/>the Children in <placeName>Moravia</placeName>. I heard that we must get a 
                  <lb/>new Heart if we will be saved, &amp; that God alone was able 
                  <lb/>to give it. This occasioned new Perplexity in me, seeing
                  <lb/>that I was deficient herein <add>&amp;</add> I was much troubled. I at the
                  <lb/>same Time looked out for some Companions, to whom I would
                  <lb/>discover this my Concern, &amp; our Saviour gave me eight who
                  <lb/>had the same Mind; we often went into hollow Roads and
                  <lb/>Bushes, where we were alone, &amp; wept and prayed for the new Heart.
                  <lb/>A Hope was also kindled within me, that I should become 
                  <lb/>a Partaker of it, tho' I felt myself very unworthy.</p>

                  <lb/>In <date>1727</date> the Persecution in <placeName>Moravia</placeName> rose to that Pitch
                  <lb/>that Orders were given, that everyone should swear Allegiance
                  <lb/>to the roman catholic Religion. My Mother who had a
                  <lb/>faithful Heart to our Savior, would &amp; could not do it, but

                  <lb/>resolved rather to emigrate. She asked me whether I would
                          <lb/>accompany her? I consented directly, &amp; the Concern of our Heart
                          <lb/>to see our Souls saved, was so great, that nothing could detain us.

                          <lb/>Leave of him. He recomended us there to the Protection of the Lord, 
                          <lb/>and said to me during a particular Sense of the Peace of God: " I
                          <lb/>am sure I shall find thee once among the Number of those who are
                          <lb/>with the Lord " On our Journey we were several times in Danger
                          <lb/>of our Lives, &amp; besides this had to suffer much Distress, Hard
                          <lb/>ships &amp; Anxiety. But our Savior helped us, so that we arrived

                          <lb/><hi rend="strikethrough">attended</hi> with many Tears to think also of me. I went here to
                          <lb/>School to <persName>Mr. Krumpa</persName>, who often told us that he loved the
                          <lb/>Lord Jesus, because he had shed his Blood for us. This excited
                          <lb/>in me a Confidence to our Savior that he probably had also
                          <lb/>shed his Blood for me, &amp; would have Mercy upon me. At the
                          <lb/>Time when in <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName> the great Awakening among the Children
                          <lb/>began, he asked once his Scholars: Whether they also would love
                          <lb/>our Savior &amp; give him their Hearts, so that He might wash them
                          <lb/>wih his Blood? With those who expressed a Desire for it, he
                          <lb/>made a Covenant, to love Him above all Things who loved us
                          <lb/>first. Upon which Occasion He in whose Eyes we were precious
                          <lb/>walked certainly in our Midst, &amp; none of us knew what had hap,
                          <lb/>pened unto us. It occasioned a great Joy in <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, that our 
                          <lb/>Savior had also graciously visited the Children in <placeName>Berthelsdorf</placeName>.
                          <lb/>We wept &amp; prayed together during an inexpressible Feeling of the
                          <lb/>Nearness of Jesus.

                          <lb/>My Parents moved soon after to <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, where we had
                          <lb/>it outwardly very pinching &amp; hard. But I must say to the 
                          <lb/>Praise of our Savior, that I could suit myself pretty well into
                          <lb/>poor Circumstances, for I had left my Mother Country with
                          <lb/>no other Intention, than to be satisfied with Bread and Water.
                          <lb/>But the H. Ghost begun a new Work in me. I learned to know
                          <lb/>our Savior as the Friend of poor Sinners; he forgave me 
                          <lb/>the Sin of Not believing in Him and His Merit, &amp; showed me my

                          <lb/>feel when he cleared it up to me, that His Sufferings, his Death
                          <lb/>&amp; Bloodshedding had also happened for my sake, &amp; that I was
                          <lb/>his Property. I could not sufficiently contemplate our Savior
                          <lb/>in his Sufferings Beauty, whereby all external Troubles &amp;
                          <lb/>Difficulties were made quite easy to me. In <date>January 1729</date>
                          <lb/>I was to my inexpressible Joy admitted to the H. Comunion
                          <lb/>with the Congrn. I then made |: as it was the Custom at that

                          <lb/>long with Soul &amp; Body to my Redeemer &amp; devote to Him
                          <lb/>Life &amp; All. In this blessed Enjoyment of our Savior, I went
                          <lb/>on during a particular Care of the never to be forgotten Dis-
                          <lb/>ciple of the Lord, <persName>Count Zinzendorf</persName>, who took much Care &amp;

                          <lb/>Care of some young Countesses. Here I was to my Heart
                          <lb/>somewhat removed from the Simplicity in Christ Jesus.
                          <lb/>But our Savior, according to his great Faithfulness, did not
                          <lb/>suffer me to be plucked out of his Hand, but renewed in me that

                          <lb/>there arose soon a Persecution against the Brethren, so that we

                          <lb/>We lived yet sometime very chearful &amp; in Sickness, &amp; the va-
                          <lb/>rious Frights, which never were wanting, were so much the easier
                          <lb/>to be born, because we could still live together. But still in the
                          <lb/>same Year it pleased our dear Lord to take our faithful Friend
                          <lb/><persName>Secretary Nabakof </persName>out of this World. He believed in Jesus. During the
                          <lb/>Direction of his Successor, who did not know us, we were first more
                          <lb/>confined, and in the Night of the <date>28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of Aug.</date> my Husband and the <persName>Brn
                          <lb/>Helterhof</persName> &amp; <persName>Fritshe</persName> were fetched &amp; carried away, without knowing
                          <lb/><hi rend="underline">why</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">whither</hi>. I myself had to assist in putting my Husband who
                          <lb/>was sick unto Death into an open Boat, &amp; see him thus carried away
                          <lb/>on the Water in Storm &amp; Rain. We two Sisters spent the Night weeping,
                          <lb/>&amp; when the next Morning Enquiry was made of those who had carried
                          <lb/>them away, whether they had been brought; we were still more frighted
                          <lb/>by fearful Accounts of their Fate. At last we received the joyful
                          <lb/>News, that they had been brought to their former Prison, &amp; that we
                          <lb/>might visit them. We hastened directly to them, to bring them 
                          <lb/>some Refreshments. This proved to be a great Joy to see those
                          <lb/>yet alive whom we believed dead. To my great Astonishment
                          <lb/>I found my Husband a little better, tho' sometimes so weak, that 
                          <lb/>I went away in the Evening with the Thought of having seen him
                          <lb/>the last Time. I spoke confidently with our Savior about there
                          <lb/>Circumstances, and He convinced me that it was according to His Heart

                          <lb/>Husband was also convincedof it, &amp; we encouraged each other
                          <lb/>often to be resigned to our Fate, &amp; happy &amp; chearful in the Near-
                          <lb/>ness of our dr. Lord, and to have all our Troubles sweetened by
                          <lb/>the Converse with Him. Leave was indeed given us to visit the
                          <lb/>Brethren in the Day Time as often as we pleased; but there were
                          <lb/>always People who made it very difficult, <unclear>you</unclear> often impossible
                          <lb/>for us, &amp; thus we got one Fright after another. And besides this
                          <lb/>our Savr. took in <date>1755</date> <persName>Sr. Helterhof </persName>to himself, &amp; thus I was quite 
                          <lb/>alone in the House with my Child. Not understanding the russian
                          <lb/>Language, &amp; being obliged to leave my Child alone in the House,
                          <lb/>when I had to go out, &amp; being in continual Danger of a <sic>Sur,
                             <lb/>prize</sic> <corr>Surprise </corr>by Robbers; the Brn. &amp; Srs. in <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> advised me
                          <lb/>to make Application to the Cong<hi rend="underline">rn</hi> for somebody to assist me, &amp;
                          <lb/>I got <persName>Br. Grumberg </persName>who took a most faithful Care of me &amp; my
                          <lb/>Child. I had also taken a russian Girl out of Compassion , who got
                          <lb/>a Love for our Savior, &amp; when I went out |:for I had to carry to
                          <lb/>the Brn. all their Necessaries:| she entertained my Child with Singing
                          <lb/>Verses. Once in Winter <date>1757</date> when going over the <placeName>River Neva</placeName>, the 
                          <lb/>Ice broke under me, &amp; the Stream carried me a Piece along,
                          <lb/>so that I must have been drowned, if the Eye &amp; Watchman of
                          <lb/>Israel had not so faithfully preserved me, But I became very
                          <lb/>sickly afterwards. In this Distress I prayed fervently to our

                          <lb/>of Tears &amp; Trouble, though it should even be done in ever so
                          <lb/>great Weakness. And this He has done graciously &amp; helped me
                          <lb/>so, that through it seemed sometimes as if the <unclear>Tabernacle</unclear> would
                          <lb/>break, the B<hi rend="underline">rn.</hi> suffered however no Want. At this Time I had
                          <lb/>a particular Confidence in conversing with our Savior. One of
                          <lb/>these Conversations in <date>Oct. 1758 </date>was very imppressive to me, when
                          <lb/>I spoke fully with him about my whole Course of Life, &amp; was
                          <lb/>richly comforted about all my Mistakes. In <date>Febr. 1759 </date>we were
                          <lb/>at last set at Liberty, but ordered to go to Casan. We were 5 in
                          <lb/>Number, viz. my Husband, the <persName>B<hi rend="underline">rn.</hi> Helterhof</persName> &amp; <persName>Fritshe</persName> &amp; I &amp; my
                          <lb/>Child. On this Journey new Trials came upon us. The Brethren could
                          <lb/>not bear the violent Shaking of the Waggons, on the bad Roads &amp;
                          <lb/>Causeways, made of round Wood, after sitting so long in Prison, &amp;
                          <lb/>they had to suffer much, particularly my Husband, who had always
                          <lb/>been weak. Add to this the Fright of being attacked by Robbers on the
                          <lb/>other side of <placeName>Moscovia</placeName>, who most cruelly beat our Guards; he be-
                          <lb/>came quite enervated, &amp; a mortal Sickness befel him, so that he
                          <lb/>lost his Speech. His Mouth was at were burnt up, &amp; his Tongue
                          <lb/>withered, I had not even as much as a Drop of Water to refresh
                          <lb/>him. I often begged our Savior to comfort him with his Thirst. Besides
                          <lb/>this we saw nothing but inexpressible Difficulties before us. The People
                          <lb/>did not like to have any Dealings with us, because we had Soldiers
                          <lb/>with us, so that we often did not know, where to get a Morsel to eat,
                          <lb/>particularly as it was Lent Season, wherein the Russians are very

                          <lb/>we met with more friendly People,who looked upon &amp; loved as par-
                          <lb/>ticular good Christians &amp; Children of God, &amp; served as as well as
                          <lb/>they could. We felt well among these People, &amp; I believe they will be
                          <lb/>counted among those to whom Jesus will say: I was sick and ye
                          <lb/>have come to the highest Pitch, for he could not even move his
                          <lb/>Tongue, &amp; lay quite speech &amp; senseless. The Creature begun now to
                          <lb/>plead with the Creator, &amp; I was quite at a Loss what to think or say, 
                          <lb/>when I considered that the Departure of my Husband was so near
                          <lb/>at Hand. But then in my greatest Trouble, &amp; when I was at the
                          <lb/>Brink of Despair, the loving Heart of Jesus interfered, &amp; set Bounds
                          <lb/>to the raging Waves; for our Savior gave Strength to my Husband
                          <lb/>that he in some Measure recovered, so that, to my great <sic>Surprize</sic> <corr>Surprise </corr>he 
                          <lb/>spoke fully with me about our Course hither to, &amp; particularly about
                          <lb/>this Journey, whereas he could not speak one Word before. He said
                          <lb/>among the rest: Be not discouraged about these Circumstances; thou
                          <lb/>knowest that our Savior already in <date>1738</date> gave Directions, that we
                          <lb/>through <placeName>Russia</placeName> should go to <placeName><sic>Assia <corr>Asia</corr></sic></placeName>, but the Enemy has thrown some
                          <lb/>Obstacles in the Way, so that it was stopt, about which I never could
                          <lb/>be satisfied, but now our Savr., with whom I have kept up on un,
                          <lb/>interrupted Conexion, amidst my Weaknesses of Soul &amp; Body has
                          <lb/>satisfied me about it, by this that the russian Government itself
                          <lb/>sends us now thither, so that we however shall see Asia, &amp; sojourn in it.
                          <lb/>My great Weakness is a natural Consequence of the great &amp; sudden

                          <lb/>Alteration of my Way of Life hitherto, &amp; belongs to the final Com-

                          <lb/>Sufferings I am made conformable to my best Friend. Our Savior
                          <lb/>well certainly restore my Health so that I shall reach the Place of

                          <lb/>yet I had to care for &amp; nurse him like a Child. At last <date>Apr 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 
                          <lb/>1769</date> we arrived at <placeName>Casan</placeName>, having been three times in evident

                          <lb/>In <placeName>Casan</placeName> we found it better, than we expected. The People there
                          <lb/>showed much Love &amp; Respect to us, and even the Governor himself
                          <lb/>behaved very friendly towards us. I often begged our Savior to
                          <lb/>give us at least one Soul, where our Testimony of him might
                          <lb/>find Entrance, &amp; it was not a small Satisfaction to us, that

                          <lb/>and Turks. I wept &amp; prayed much both on the Journey &amp; particu-

                          <lb/>or evading it, for on one Side was already upon Water above the Ice
                          <lb/>&amp; on the other was a very steep high Shore. In this Distress came the
                          <lb/>Captain through the Water to us, broke off Branches from the Bushes
                          <lb/>which grew along the Shore, &amp; covered the Holes with them, &amp; himself
                          <lb/>led our Horses over them. And thus with the Help of God, we were de-
                          <lb/>livered out of this Distress, in which we had been from Noon till towards

                          <lb/>Midnight. The Captain cared for me &amp; my Child throughout the whole
                          <lb/>Journey like a Father, did not only pay all Expences, but let always one
                          <lb/>of his Servants stay with us, &amp; when distressing Circumstances occurred 
                          <lb/>he himself with some others hastened to our Assistance. He everywhere
                          <lb/>gave us out to be his Relations, &amp; took Care of our Things in the best
                          <lb/>Manner. I brought my Child very sick of the small Pox to <placeName>Mascovia</placeName>; but
                          <lb/>as the Captain would take me with him as far as <placeName>Novograd</placeName>. I set out 
                          <lb/>with my Child sick as it was, &amp; our Savior prevented all ill Consequences.
                          <lb/>But in <placeName>Novograd</placeName> where our Road parted, the Captain was very un,
                          <lb/>easy about me, particularly as he had heard of his Servants, that
                          <lb/>my Drivers had evil Designs against me, as soon as we should
                          <lb/>be alone. But in this Perplexity, we met quite unexpectedly, &amp; to
                          <lb/>our Joy, as russian <persName>Lieutenant of the Guard Milkanoth</persName>, who was
                          <lb/>a good Friend of the Captain, &amp; also knew <persName>Br. Koehler</persName> in <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>
                          <lb/>very well, who was also travelling thither. I took Leave of my Bene,
                          <lb/>factor with a thankful Heart, and he delivered me to the Lieutenant
                          <lb/>as his Relation, &amp; begged him to pay strict Attention to our Things
                          <lb/>&amp; Drivers, &amp; not suffer them to stay behind with me, saying: All you
                          <lb/>do unto her I shall look upon as done unto myself. The Lieutenant
                          <lb/>executed also his Commission in the best Manner, and our Savr. brought us

                          <lb/>to be again among Brn. and Srs. But I met again with Difficulties on
                          <lb/>account of my farther Journey, everybody representing it to me 
                          <lb/>as impossible to get a Passport. But according to my Custom I re-
                          <lb/>comended also this Affair to my dear Lord, &amp; begged him to take it in

                          <lb/>sat out from <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> by Water, with my little Daughter, whom I had
                          <lb/>preserved as a particular Gift with all possible Care &amp; Faithfulness,
                          <lb/>accompanied by <persName>Br. Kryman</persName>, <date>May 18th. 1761</date>. The taking Leave of the
                          <lb/>Brn. &amp; Srs. here was very painful on both Sides. Towards Evening we
                          <lb/>set Sail, but we soon got a Storm, which was against us, &amp; a total
                          <lb/>Eclipse of the Moon rendered it quite dark, so that we saw nothing
                          <lb/>before us but our Destruction, particularly as our Vessel was
                          <lb/>too deeply laden, &amp; the <placeName>Neva</placeName> being in that Place full of Sand Banks.

                          <lb/>me thro', &amp; we could now pursue our Voyage without any Hindrance.
                          <lb/>I now looked once more at the Land of my Troubles with Tears
