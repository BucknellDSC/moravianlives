					<l>The S. Sr Sus. Smith who departed</l>
					<l>this life Dec 19th 1814 has left</l>
					<l>the following short account concern</l>
					<l>ing herself:</l>
					<l>I was born at Morton Bank, in the </l>
					<l>parish of Bingley Jan. 6th 1746.</l>
					<l>Two days after my birth my Mother</l>
					<l>departed this life and I was put</l>
					<l>to my Grandmother to be nursed.</l>
					<l>My Father went to live for some</l>
					<l>time in the S Brns Oeconomy at </l>
					<l>Smith house hear Wyke, and after</l>
					<l>a few years he moved to Fulneck</l>
					<l>where he was married the 3 time,</l>
					<l>on this occation he took me home</l>
					<l>again, being then in my 7th year. </l>
					<l>I often call to mind the blessings</l>
					<l>I then injoyed in attending the </l>
					<l>Childrens meetings, particularly once</l>
					<l>when Count Zinsendorf on our Congn</l>
					<l>day spoke to us much of our Sav</l>
					<l>love, and when the meeting was over</l>
					<l>came to ask each of us separate</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1030.jpg' n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>if we loved our Saviour which made </l>
					<l>a days impression on my heart.</l>
					<l>I my 15th year I came to live in </l>
					<l>the Srs house here, I entered with</l>
					<l>thankfulness, as I felt myself very</l>
					<l>unworthy of such a priviledge,</l>
					<l>I found myself soon at home, lived</l>
					<l>for sometime very happy, and with</l>
					<l>the meetings I was greatly delighted. </l>
					<l>In externals it was difficult, nothing</l>
					<l>but spinning, however as long as I </l>
					<l>was satisfied, I did well; but when </l>
					<l>I deviated from the right path I </l>
					<l>grew unhappy and discontended, this</l>
					<l>brought me into trouble and dark</l>
					<l>ness, reasoning and dispare, I wish&apos;d</l>
					<l>to injoy priviledges in the Congn</l>
					<l>but had to wait 7 years before I </l>
					<l>was recd. Still my Saviour had</l>
					<l>thoughts of peace over me, and </l>
					<l>gave me grace to reflect on the </l>
					<l>past time, I felt and found that </l>
					<l>I had not been attentive to the </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>voice of his holy Spirit, nor put my</l>
					<l>trust and confidence in him, this </l>
					<l>brought me into deep concern, I </l>
					<l>wept &amp; prayed many nights and days</l>
					<l>that our Saviour would pardon my</l>
					<l>sins and transgressions, and receive</l>
					<l>me anew as his property, and I thank</l>
					<l>him this day, for his pardon, mercy</l>
					<l>and comfort which he then imparted</l>
					<l>to me. Nov. 13th 1768 I was recd</l>
					<l>into the Congn and Sept 8th 1772</l>
					<l>I had the favour to partake the first</l>
					<l>time of the H Comn which proved</l>
					<l>days of solid belssings to me, and </l>
					<l>I felt again happy and comfort</l>
					<l>able, injoyed our Saviours nearness</l>
					<l>and the priviliges of the Congn</l>
					<l>proved a great refreshment and</l>
					<l>incouragement to my poor and needy</l>
					<l>soul. But alas! I soon again</l>
					<l>came into a dark and reasoning </l>
					<l>way, on which account I had many</l>
					<l>heavy hours, my uneasiness of mind</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1031.jpg' n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>was very great, I went to the H</l>
					<l>Comn often when I felt and knew</l>
					<l>it would have been better for me</l>
					<l>not to partake of this heavenly </l>
					<l>repast. Often I thought I would </l>
					<l>run away where I might be seen</l>
					<l>no more, and once I did set off</l>
					<l>and went to Mortenbank to a</l>
					<l>Relation, but feeling no rest there</l>
					<l>neither, I returned back again.</l>
					<l>I shall never forget the kindness</l>
					<l>then shown to me, of which I </l>
					<l>was so undeserving, but above all</l>
					<l>the mercy, love and forbearance of </l>
					<l>my Saviour, who still had not forsaken</l>
					<l>me; but kept his hand over me</l>
					<l>his erring Sheep. I stayed now</l>
					<l>from the H Comn for several </l>
					<l>times, the Lord had much to do </l>
					<l>for me, he pardoned my sins and </l>
					<l>washed them away in his precious</l>
					<l>Blood, and the 13th of Aug 1780</l>
					<l>when I had the great favour again</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to draw near to the table of the Lord</l>
					<l>to partake of his Body and Blood </l>
					<l>in the Holy Sacrament, it proved</l>
					<l>to me an injoyment which I never</l>
					<l>shall forget. Now when I reflect</l>
					<l>on my ihequered course, I find</l>
					<l>thousand reasons to fall down at my</l>
					<l>Saviours feet, to thank and praise </l>
					<l>him for his unwearied faithfulness</l>
					<l>his patience and longsuffering, and</l>
					<l>tho I have often grieved him and </l>
					<l>disobeed the voice of his holy</l>
					<l>still </l>
					<l>spirit; he sought and found me </l>
					<l>when I strayed from him, and</l>
					<l>received me with open arms of mercy.</l>
					<l>&quot;O thou my yesterday to day &amp; ever</l>
					<l>&quot;most faithful Saviour. I have</l>
					<l>nothing more to say, as Lord Jesus!</l>
					<l>I am a poor Sinner, who would fain</l>
					<l>thro&apos; the Lambs ransom entrance gain.&quot;</l>
					<l>May he now prepare me for his </l>
					<l>heavenly Kingdom, where I shall </l>
					<l>praise him for ever, for what</l>

					<l>he has done for me unworthy sinner</l>
					<l>here below.</l>
					<l>Thus far she dictated to a friend</l>
					<l>in Sept 1809.</l>
					<l>At that time she was in a very</l>
					<l>poor state of state of health, and</l>
					<l>thought that her time here below</l>
					<l>would not be long. However it </l>
					<l>pleased the Lord to restore her</l>
					<l>sofar that she could go about again</l>
					<l>tho in weakness and feeling many </l>
					<l>infirmities, whereby her faith</l>
					<l>and patience was often tried.</l>
					<l>As she has candidly stated herself </l>
					<l>the various scenes of trials in which </l>
					<l>the the Lord has helped her thro&apos;</l>
					<l>we shall not innumerate any thing </l>
					<l>now; but unite our thanks and</l>
					<l>praises with hers, to him, who</l>
					<l>has had patience with her in</l>
					<l>time of need, and heard her prayers</l>
					<l>in the accepted time; who has done</l>
					<l>all things well, and now brought</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>her to her desired haven.</l>
					<l>Within this last year she suffered</l>
					<l>much with pain and weakness. </l>
					<l>On Dec. 11th she injoyed the H.</l>
					<l>Comn with 5 other Sisters in the </l>
					<l>Sickroom, she expressed herself after</l>
					<l>wards very grateful, and said:</l>
					<l>What I felt on this occation I shall</l>
					<l>never forget, it was a foretaste</l>
					<l>of Eternity, O Eternity! when shall</l>
					<l>I once be there, with my dear Savr</l>
					<l>surely, it cannot be very long.</l>
					<l>Tho she grew weaker, yet neither she</l>
					<l>nor we thought her departure so near.</l>
					<l>On the 18th in a conversation, when</l>
					<l>amongst other things she was asked </l>
					<l>if any thing desturbed her mind, and</l>
					<l>if she felt quit resigned to our</l>
					<l>Saviours will? She replied: &quot;I have</l>
					<l>done with every thing. but you know</l>
					<l>dying has always been an aweful</l>
					<l>however</l>
					<l>thing to me, but I have that </l>
					<l>firm asurance that our Saviour</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1033.jpg' n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>will receive me, poor and worthless</l>
					<l>as I am; I can say nothing, </l>
					<l>but Lord have mercy upon me!</l>
					<l>she was </l>
					<l>In the evening pretty easy but in</l>
					<l>the night she grew very restless</l>
					<l>and her breathing very difficult,</l>
					<l>and she prayed fervently to our </l>
					<l>Saviour to help her, in the mor</l>
					<l>ning on the 19th having received </l>
					<l>the blessing for her departure</l>
					<l>she breathed her last during</l>
					<l>the singing of that verse.</l>
					<l>When in the arms of Jesus</l>
					<l>thy Lips shall pallid grow. </l>
					<l>Aged 68 years 11 months.</l>
