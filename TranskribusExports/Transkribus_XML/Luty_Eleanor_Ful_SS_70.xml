					<l>The life of the Single Sister Elenor Luty.</l>
					<l>I was born Sepr 20th 1718 at Killing Hall near</l>
					<l>near, Harrowgale, in the Parish of Ripley, and was </l>
					<l>brought up in the Church of England. My Mother</l>
					<l>wishing</l>
					<l>kept a strict eye upon me to preserve me from the</l>
					<l>temptations of the world. When I was about 6 years</l>
					<l>old, I used to read in the New Testament, and was </l>
					<l>always very inquisitive with my School Mr what</l>
					<l>at that time</l>
					<l>could be the meaning of many things beyond my capacity </l>
					<l>examined</l>
					<l>In my 16th year I was by the Minister of our</l>
					<l>in the doctrines of Christianity </l>
					<l>Church as a preparation for the holy Communion, preveius</l>
					<l>to the enjoyment of it, and was confirmed by the Bishop</l>
					<l>durring his visit in these parts. The above mentioned</l>
					<l>Minister told me and several young people that our own </l>
					<l>hearts were our greatest enemies; this I could not compre</l>
					<l>hend at that time, tho&apos; under concern for my Salvation.</l>
					<l>My Confirmation had a very blessed effect, encreasing my</l>
					<l>anxiety, and making me more in earnest to seek the Lord.</l>
					<l>I now resolved not to rest satisfied till I had found him,</l>
					<l>and made my Calling and Election sure.</l>
					<l>A few hours before my Fathers departure, he sent for</l>
					<l>all his Children 10 in number, to give each his farewell </l>

					<l>Benediction, but I being from home was sent for, and</l>
					<l>told that my Father could not depart till I came to </l>
					<l>his last blessing, which be imparted to me with his hand</l>
					<l>upon my head, the fervency of his prayer made a deep</l>
					<l>impression on me. In my 7th year I went to live with</l>
					<l>a Milliner as a Servant at Riffon, here I was in great</l>
					<l>danger of being drawn into things contrary to the mind of</l>
					<l>my Saviour, had not his protecting hand been over me.</l>
					<l>The minister who baptized me, wished me not to stay</l>
					<l>any longer in that place, and procured another in a reput</l>
					<l>able family, here I lived 2 years, and they having no child</l>
					<l>treated me exceeding kind, and beloved in all respects as</l>
					<l>a Father and Mother to me, during their time I had a dan</l>
					<l>gerous Illness, to that the Physican disposed of my recovery</l>
					<l>and I was in great distress of soul, without any </l>
					<l>of my happiness, not knowing how to obtain it, for my</l>
					<l>Master and Mrs frequently told me it was time enough</l>
					<l>to be uneasy about my soul, but I found their advice was</l>
					<l>wrong, being much alarmed of my stake of heart, how-</l>
					<l>ever it pleased the lord at that time to restore me to proper</l>
					<l>health. I went for sometime to my Sister of Killing-</l>
					<l>Hall, here I began to think of settling in the world, and</l>
					<l>engaged so far, that I promised marriage to a young</l>
					<l>man with whom I thought I could live happy, but</l>
					<l>whilst preparations were making for our marriage </l>

					<l>a clergyman, who had heard of me, by one of my former</l>
					<l>Mistresses, wished me to go in service to the marquis</l>
					<l>of Rockingham near Sheffield to which I consorted, here</l>
					<l>I felt very uncomfortable, there being a great member</l>
					<l>of Servants, who were persecutions of our Savior and his </l>
					<l>People, and I was very uneasy among them, being much</l>
					<l>afraid I should suffer harm in my Soul, and never be saved.</l>
					<l>I frequently went to hear David Taylor preach, his Sermons</l>
					<l>were very applicable to my case, more especially when he</l>
					<l>treated of our Saviors sufferings for poor sinners. at this</l>
					<l>time I was very much hurt with all the Servants, partic</l>
					<l>ularly the Steward, who said that all tho went to hear</l>
					<l>those preach should have a small house that stood near</l>
					<l>the Fishpond to receive grace in, and the Pond to wash</l>
					<l>their sins away, but not long after, this same man was</l>
					<l>drowned in that very pond. I now resolved to leave this</l>
					<l>place, as I could not be happy here, so I left them, and not</l>
					<l>any </l>
					<l>knowing body but the Farmer where I first heard David</l>
					<l>Taylor preach, I beged him to conduct me to my Mother, </l>
					<l>which he did as far as Leeds from there I walked home</l>
					<l>to my Parents, being quite tired of Service, among uncon</l>
					<l>verted People, my relations being at that time also in an </l>
					<l>to leave</l>
					<l>unconverted state of mind, I was resolved them and seek</l>
					<l>a people of god with whom I could be in fellowship</l>

					<l>The methodists preached in our neighborhood, but</l>
					<l>I found no clearness to join their concession, I accidently</l>
					<l>met with a person who informed me that there</l>
					<l>was a sort of people in Pudsey, who would suite me</l>
					<l>Upon this information I left my Fathers house on foot,</l>
					<l>and did not know one stop of the way, but thought</l>
					<l>if I could meet with a carrier that went that road,</l>
					<l>I would go with him, accordingly I soon met with one</l>
					<l>and we walked together to the place I was seeking.</l>
					<l>I arrived Sept 6th 1742, and stayed 15 weeks in Pudsey</l>
					<l>working for my living till at last Sisr Gussinbaus</l>
					<l>who then lived with Br and Sr Hillad took me to her</l>
					<l>self, on that very day the young man came to the house,</l>
					<l>whom I had promised marriage, and wanted to fetch me,</l>
					<l>but I told him that I would marry no man at present</l>
					<l>for I belonged intirely to our Savior, he told me that</l>
					<l>my mother wanted it to take place, but I persisted in</l>
					<l>my resolution, and was soon after taken by Br and Sr</l>
					<l>Heskenwolder to Low house, where there was an ocon</l>
					<l>omy of S. Srs near Fulneck, I no sooner arrived there</l>
					<l>than I melted into tears of gratitude at the feet of my</l>
					<l>dear Savior, for his unwearied patience, love and</l>
					<l>faithful care in bringing me safely to his people.</l>
					<l>I remained so happy for sometime in this place that</l>
					<l>I thought it a Heaven upon earth, but after more </l>

				<lg>
					<l>insight into the nature of a Congregation my feel</l>
					<l>ings altered, I entered into a close examination of </l>
					<l>myself, how for this change of circumstance would</l>
					<l>just with my turn of mind. At last thro&apos; the grace</l>
					<l>of our Savior I came to this resolution to take up my</l>
					<l>cross and follow Him, and to submit to his Will in every</l>
					<l>tryal, he thought best for me and which I soon experi</l>
					<l>as I sow one after the other, received into the Congregation</l>
					<l>to which I thought I had a might preferable to him,</l>
					<l>Our Savior suffered this tryal to be a means of my</l>
					<l>becoming better acquainted with myself and pointed</l>
					<l>out to me what was my hindrance in not attaining to</l>
					<l>the priviledges of the Congregation / namely/ my</l>
					<l>self righteousness and unbroken spirit</l>
					<l>I became sensible of it, and owned into </l>
					<l>thro&apos; his enabling grace resigned to his </l>
					<l>He granted me that favor June 8th 1746 to be </l>
					<l>into the Congregation, and what was still much </l>
					<l>to partake of his Body and Blood in the holy Sacr</l>
					<l>March 25th 1747 which excited me anew to surrender</l>
					<l>myself entirely to His Guidance, and I entreated our</l>
					<l>Savior to give me now grace, that I might be obedint</l>
					<l>to his holy Spirit, and do what would be pleasing</l>
					<l>to Him. Soon after this I want to London to apist</l>

					<l>School</l>
					<l>in washing for the Children at Milend In 1755</l>
					<l>returned to Fulneck into the Srs house here. Sometime</l>
					<l>after want again into service in Fulneck, and again re</l>
					<l>turned into my favorit house among the S. Srs</l>
					<l>Since my coming to the Congregation I have exper</l>
					<l>ienced many tryals informally and externally, and</l>
					<l>am sensible I have nothing to boast of with respect</l>
					<l>to my natural disposition, which has caused others</l>
					<l>and myself much trouble, but my good Savior</l>
					<l>whom I love above all things in Heaven or earth</l>
					<l>bears with me, and has kept my confidence unshak</l>
					<l>en in Him to this moment; and wile no doubt do</l>
					<l>is to the end. I cannot omit a circumstance,</l>
					<l>whil is a proof of my Lords parental love and care</l>
					<l>over me. My dispotein was not only unbroken</l>
					<l>and selfrighteous, but besides this, I had</l>
					<l>a too anxious care for the things of this life, which</l>
					<l>carried me so far, that I found myself in a dangerous</l>
					<l>way of loosing the enjoyment of my Saviors sweet</l>
					<l>nearness thereby. I was very fond of work, which</l>
					<l>is undoubtedly right in its place, but even this I</l>
					<l>carried too far, my mind being so much taken up</l>
					<l>with it, but our Savior who knew this to be the case</l>
					<l>permitted me to have a dangerous fall from a chair, </l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>by means of which my right arm was so disabled</l>
					<l>that I never after could work as I had done before,</l>
					<l>this was a painful circumstance, and I could</l>
					<l>not look on it in any other lights, than as a chas</l>
					<l>tisement from the Lord, for acting contrary to </l>
					<l>conviction, but I am now richly comforted, with</l>
					<l>that promise: All things shall work together</l>
					<l>for good to them that love God. I am his sheep</l>
					<l>and nothing shall pluck me out of his Hand.</l>
					<l>Thus far her own Account.</l>
					<l>Our late Sister has given to genuine and </l>
					<l>upright account, both of her internal and external</l>
					<l>course that we find no occasion to add any thing</l>
					<l>particular thereto. She has been for sometime thro&apos;</l>
					<l>her advanced age, and bodily infirmities, confined</l>
					<l>to her room, and her mental faculties perceptibly</l>
					<l>decreasing, made it in several respects heavy to </l>
					<l>herself and very troublesome to those who had to do</l>
					<l>with her, and great patience was requisit to</l>
					<l>wait on her; but we must acknowledge as she</l>
					<l>herself expresses it that she was certainly</l>

					<l>one of our Saviors Sheep / and even amidst </l>
					<l>her incoherent conversation she was sometime</l>
					<l>before her departure, pleasing to all who visit</l>
					<l>ed her, for when her mind was composed she</l>
					<l>would repeatedly say: that nobody should be</l>
					<l>uneasy about her, for whenever we should </l>
					<l>hear that she was departed, either by night</l>
					<l>or day, we mnight be sure that she was happy</l>
					<l>by with our dear Savior.</l>
					<l>On the 31st of March in the afternoon she</l>
					<l>particularly desired to be blessed for her depart</l>
					<l>done </l>
					<l>ures which was accordingly because she believed</l>
					<l>she should go to our Savior that night, which</l>
					<l>came to pass in her 81st year.</l>
					<l>On March 31st she fell softly &amp;</l>
					<l>happily asleep in the 81st yr of her age. </l>
