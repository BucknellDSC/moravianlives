					<l>Grace Willsons</l>
					<l>was born Ap: 1 1737 at Wortley in the parish of</l>
					<l>Leeds. My parents belong&apos;d the church of Eng: but</l>
					<l>frequenting the Brns Meetings, they took us Children very</l>
					<l>much </l>
					<l>often with them, My Mother would often Speak with me </l>
					<l>concerning how I might love Our Savr but I had no</l>
					<l>understanding of it yet I felt my self much pleased</l>
					<l>&amp; my Ears attentively Open to all which I heard the Brn Speak</l>
					<l>who kept the meetings, &amp; was particularly awe&apos;d and</l>
					<l>restraind from Many Childest &amp; selfways, thro&apos; a real</l>
					<l>fear of Griveing our dear Saviour, who had Suffer&apos;d much</l>
					<l>out of Love to Me. when disobedience over took me it</l>
					<l>made My mind uneasey &amp; I often went alone to weep,</l>
					<l>with real Longing to become acquainted with him</l>
					<l>whom I thus offended</l>
					<l>Bn Helt as Children parent often kept their Meetings</l>
					<l>And when he Spoak of our Savrs blood &amp; wounds, my</l>
					<l>Heart filld presantly with Love &amp; tenderness, so that</l>
					<l>it was a most pleaseing Subject to me, &amp; particularly</l>
					<l>at one meeting, in which Bn Helt asked The Children</l>
					<l>Many Questions, concerning our Svrs wounds, &amp; which</l>
					<l>was The greatest &amp; what it was that pirced our Savrs</l>
					<l>Side, also what flowed from this Larg wound Hole</l>
					<l>a particular impression moved my heart, to answer all</l>
					<l>these Questions, &amp; when I name&apos;d that blood &amp; water</l>
					<l>flowed out of His Side, I Then was overpowere&apos;d</l>

				<lg>
					<l>with such a peculiar feeling &amp; that most Lovely</l>
					<l>form with all His wounds &amp; bruises, stood before me,</l>
					<l>Now it was quite Clear to me, what had attacked my</l>
					<l>Heart &amp; drawn me impreceptably thro&apos; my Childrens</l>
					<l>years, Thus in His dear nearness I went happily on</l>
					<l>And in My 14 year, I was taken into the Gr Girls</l>
					<l>Choir, which was a grace &amp; blessing to me; But in some</l>
					<l>small time after I came into doubting over my self</l>
					<l>Whether I Stood in a right connection with our Savr</l>
					<l>for I became quite Miserable, all at once, &amp; feeling my</l>
					<l>Corrupted Nature, made me disspair of Our Savr Ever</l>
					<l>havering ought to do with me again, Thus I went on</l>
					<l>believeing ev&apos;ry body happier then myself, frequently </l>
					<l>I beg&apos;d &amp; pray&apos;d my dearest Savr to forgive me all the wretched</l>
					<l>ness &amp; Sin which I felt in me, &amp; make me once again</l>
					<l>is happy &amp; his Cherefull Child, at Times I felt some comfort</l>
					<l>but then again it was with Drawn, yet many a Time</l>
					<l>Those words was closely impressd on my mind, Thou</l>
					<l>Shall be mine not withstanding my unbeleive</l>
					<l>prevaild, &amp; this disponding Situation, I kept much too</l>
					<l>myself, at Last I resolved to Speak about it to my</l>
					<l>Laboures, who told me just such poor Creatures our Savr</l>
					<l>wanted </l>
					<l>who cou&apos;d not help themselves, so that His Grace alone</l>
					<l>might be the only remidy for their happiness, </l>
					<l>This was such a Comfort to my Heart as words cannot</l>
					<l>Express</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>yet I found my unbeleive remaining with Me</l>
					<l>&amp; made me doubtfull over evry comfort</l>
					<l>Being Once in the preaching I heard the Sin of</l>
					<l>unbeleive particularly Expleind, &amp; that all our Missery</l>
					<l>was, the Effects of that great Sin: Here it was, as if</l>
					<l>Something Spoak loudly in my Ear, &amp; told me, That very</l>
					<l>Sin keeps Thee from being happy; I Directly beleived it </l>
					<l>to be true, &amp; found my Heart was opening towards our</l>
					<l>Savr, Instantly I begd &amp; pray&apos;d that he wou&apos;d take a</l>
					<l>way my unbeleive, &amp; give me a full assurance of his</l>
					<l>rich forgiveness, here my dearest Savr vouch safe to grant</l>
					<l>The poor petitions of a destressed Heart, feeling what</l>
					<l>Smart &amp; pain I,d cost Him, bowed me in the very dust, I can</l>
					<l>never Express how this Sight &amp; feeling of my beloved has </l>
					<l>me </l>
					<l>Mended with abiding grace, Thro&apos; the future</l>
					<l>moments of my Life? Thus I spent my time in the Gr Girls</l>
					<l>Choir, as his unworthy Child, relying on his merits</l>
					<l>sinner </l>
					<l>and forgiveness as his poor but favour&apos;d parting daily</l>
					<l>to be more &amp; more to His Hearts Joy, &amp; familiarly conversation</l>
					<l>with his dear &amp; wounded person? I still live&apos;d with my</l>
					<l>parents till my 20 year with Longings in my heart to be</l>
					<l>a Member of the congreg= in the year 57 I went to live</l>
					<l>in the occonomie at Gomersal, to my great Joy &amp; blessing</l>
