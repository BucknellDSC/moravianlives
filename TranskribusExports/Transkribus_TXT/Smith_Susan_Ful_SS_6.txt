The S. Sr Sus. Smith who departed
this life Dec 19th 1814 has left
the following short account concern
ing herself:
I was born at Morton Bank, in the 
parish of Bingley Jan. 6th 1746.
Two days after my birth my Mother
departed this life and I was put
to my Grandmother to be nursed.
My Father went to live for some
time in the S Brns Oeconomy at 
Smith house hear Wyke, and after
a few years he moved to Fulneck
where he was married the 3 time,
on this occation he took me home
again, being then in my 7th year. 
I often call to mind the blessings
I then injoyed in attending the 
Childrens meetings, particularly once
when Count Zinsendorf on our Congn
day spoke to us much of our Sav
love, and when the meeting was over
came to ask each of us separate


if we loved our Saviour which made 
a days impression on my heart.
I my 15th year I came to live in 
the Srs house here, I entered with
thankfulness, as I felt myself very
unworthy of such a priviledge,
I found myself soon at home, lived
for sometime very happy, and with
the meetings I was greatly delighted. 
In externals it was difficult, nothing
but spinning, however as long as I 
was satisfied, I did well; but when 
I deviated from the right path I 
grew unhappy and discontended, this
brought me into trouble and dark
ness, reasoning and dispare, I wish'd
to injoy priviledges in the Congn
but had to wait 7 years before I 
was recd. Still my Saviour had
thoughts of peace over me, and 
gave me grace to reflect on the 
past time, I felt and found that 
I had not been attentive to the 


voice of his holy Spirit, nor put my
trust and confidence in him, this 
brought me into deep concern, I 
wept & prayed many nights and days
that our Saviour would pardon my
sins and transgressions, and receive
me anew as his property, and I thank
him this day, for his pardon, mercy
and comfort which he then imparted
to me. Nov. 13th 1768 I was recd
into the Congn and Sept 8th 1772
I had the favour to partake the first
time of the H Comn which proved
days of solid belssings to me, and 
I felt again happy and comfort
able, injoyed our Saviours nearness
and the priviliges of the Congn
proved a great refreshment and
incouragement to my poor and needy
soul. But alas! I soon again
came into a dark and reasoning 
way, on which account I had many
heavy hours, my uneasiness of mind


was very great, I went to the H
Comn often when I felt and knew
it would have been better for me
not to partake of this heavenly 
repast. Often I thought I would 
run away where I might be seen
no more, and once I did set off
and went to Mortenbank to a
Relation, but feeling no rest there
neither, I returned back again.
I shall never forget the kindness
then shown to me, of which I 
was so undeserving, but above all
the mercy, love and forbearance of 
my Saviour, who still had not forsaken
me; but kept his hand over me
his erring Sheep. I stayed now
from the H Comn for several 
times, the Lord had much to do 
for me, he pardoned my sins and 
washed them away in his precious
Blood, and the 13th of Aug 1780
when I had the great favour again


to draw near to the table of the Lord
to partake of his Body and Blood 
in the Holy Sacrament, it proved
to me an injoyment which I never
shall forget. Now when I reflect
on my ihequered course, I find
thousand reasons to fall down at my
Saviours feet, to thank and praise 
him for his unwearied faithfulness
his patience and longsuffering, and
tho I have often grieved him and 
disobeed the voice of his holy
still 
spirit; he sought and found me 
when I strayed from him, and
received me with open arms of mercy.
"O thou my yesterday to day & ever
"most faithful Saviour. I have
nothing more to say, as Lord Jesus!
I am a poor Sinner, who would fain
thro' the Lambs ransom entrance gain."
May he now prepare me for his 
heavenly Kingdom, where I shall 
praise him for ever, for what


he has done for me unworthy sinner
here below.
Thus far she dictated to a friend
in Sept 1809.
At that time she was in a very
poor state of state of health, and
thought that her time here below
would not be long. However it 
pleased the Lord to restore her
sofar that she could go about again
tho in weakness and feeling many 
infirmities, whereby her faith
and patience was often tried.
As she has candidly stated herself 
the various scenes of trials in which 
the the Lord has helped her thro'
we shall not innumerate any thing 
now; but unite our thanks and
praises with hers, to him, who
has had patience with her in
time of need, and heard her prayers
in the accepted time; who has done
all things well, and now brought


her to her desired haven.
Within this last year she suffered
much with pain and weakness. 
On Dec. 11th she injoyed the H.
Comn with 5 other Sisters in the 
Sickroom, she expressed herself after
wards very grateful, and said:
What I felt on this occation I shall
never forget, it was a foretaste
of Eternity, O Eternity! when shall
I once be there, with my dear Savr
surely, it cannot be very long.
Tho she grew weaker, yet neither she
nor we thought her departure so near.
On the 18th in a conversation, when
amongst other things she was asked 
if any thing desturbed her mind, and
if she felt quit resigned to our
Saviours will? She replied: "I have
done with every thing. but you know
dying has always been an aweful
however
thing to me, but I have that 
firm asurance that our Saviour


will receive me, poor and worthless
as I am; I can say nothing, 
but Lord have mercy upon me!
she was 
In the evening pretty easy but in
the night she grew very restless
and her breathing very difficult,
and she prayed fervently to our 
Saviour to help her, in the mor
ning on the 19th having received 
the blessing for her departure
she breathed her last during
the singing of that verse.
When in the arms of Jesus
thy Lips shall pallid grow. 
Aged 68 years 11 months.
