Grace Willsons
was born Ap: 1 1737 at Wortley in the parish of
Leeds. My parents belong'd the church of Eng: but
frequenting the Brns Meetings, they took us Children very
much 
often with them, My Mother would often Speak with me 
concerning how I might love Our Savr but I had no
understanding of it yet I felt my self much pleased
& my Ears attentively Open to all which I heard the Brn Speak
who kept the meetings, & was particularly awe'd and
restraind from Many Childest & selfways, thro' a real
fear of Griveing our dear Saviour, who had Suffer'd much
out of Love to Me. when disobedience over took me it
made My mind uneasey & I often went alone to weep,
with real Longing to become acquainted with him
whom I thus offended
Bn Helt as Children parent often kept their Meetings
And when he Spoak of our Savrs blood & wounds, my
Heart filld presantly with Love & tenderness, so that
it was a most pleaseing Subject to me, & particularly
at one meeting, in which Bn Helt asked The Children
Many Questions, concerning our Svrs wounds, & which
was The greatest & what it was that pirced our Savrs
Side, also what flowed from this Larg wound Hole
a particular impression moved my heart, to answer all
these Questions, & when I name'd that blood & water
flowed out of His Side, I Then was overpowere'd


with such a peculiar feeling & that most Lovely
form with all His wounds & bruises, stood before me,
Now it was quite Clear to me, what had attacked my
Heart & drawn me impreceptably thro' my Childrens
years, Thus in His dear nearness I went happily on
And in My 14 year, I was taken into the Gr Girls
Choir, which was a grace & blessing to me; But in some
small time after I came into doubting over my self
Whether I Stood in a right connection with our Savr
for I became quite Miserable, all at once, & feeling my
Corrupted Nature, made me disspair of Our Savr Ever
havering ought to do with me again, Thus I went on
believeing ev'ry body happier then myself, frequently 
I beg'd & pray'd my dearest Savr to forgive me all the wretched
ness & Sin which I felt in me, & make me once again
is happy & his Cherefull Child, at Times I felt some comfort
but then again it was with Drawn, yet many a Time
Those words was closely impressd on my mind, Thou
Shall be mine not withstanding my unbeleive
prevaild, & this disponding Situation, I kept much too
myself, at Last I resolved to Speak about it to my
Laboures, who told me just such poor Creatures our Savr
wanted 
who cou'd not help themselves, so that His Grace alone
might be the only remidy for their happiness, 
This was such a Comfort to my Heart as words cannot
Express


yet I found my unbeleive remaining with Me
& made me doubtfull over evry comfort
Being Once in the preaching I heard the Sin of
unbeleive particularly Expleind, & that all our Missery
was, the Effects of that great Sin: Here it was, as if
Something Spoak loudly in my Ear, & told me, That very
Sin keeps Thee from being happy; I Directly beleived it 
to be true, & found my Heart was opening towards our
Savr, Instantly I begd & pray'd that he wou'd take a
way my unbeleive, & give me a full assurance of his
rich forgiveness, here my dearest Savr vouch safe to grant
The poor petitions of a destressed Heart, feeling what
Smart & pain I,d cost Him, bowed me in the very dust, I can
never Express how this Sight & feeling of my beloved has 
me 
Mended with abiding grace, Thro' the future
moments of my Life? Thus I spent my time in the Gr Girls
Choir, as his unworthy Child, relying on his merits
sinner 
and forgiveness as his poor but favour'd parting daily
to be more & more to His Hearts Joy, & familiarly conversation
with his dear & wounded person? I still live'd with my
parents till my 20 year with Longings in my heart to be
a Member of the congreg= in the year 57 I went to live
in the occonomie at Gomersal, to my great Joy & blessing
for my heart; this proved a necessary schooling for me, &
in the Same year May 4 I was taken into the Single
Sistrs Choir; The blessings of this festival Day will ever be
precious to me I laid myself before My Hearts best 
Ferind


& pray'd that I might prosper in this origin Choir,
Augst the 21
in the year 50 I was received into the congregation
this quite bowed me down in Shame & deep abusement
feeling Myself a poor unworthy Creature, that hour
dear &
of Grace will ever be memorable to me here & in Eternity
my heart became desirious of Liveing in the Choirrhouse
which as an unexpected fawour was granted me on
Nov 11 the Same year, for this & the Many fawours
I injoyd 
My dearest Lamb a lone know how with blushing cheeks
I have kiss his thro' pirced feet as his poor Child 
unworthy of the Smallest Grace my desire was to be a joy
to him & pleaseing unto those who had the Care of me
& also that I might be come a participant of the holy Corpses
this 
& blood fawour was Granted me May 12 1759, which 
for shame at his thro' bore'd feet, so fare
her own words
The Sacremental Graces has alway proved a peculiar &
Especial blessing to our departed Sistr who has Spent
her days in her Choir, in a cherefull happy manner
who as a Child was very much beloved by all her sistrs
which render her Course agreeable & Blessed: she often
used to speak in a Melted manner about her Election of
Grace & how our Savr had not only preserved her from
the Seductions of the world, but had also been pleased
to manifest himself in a particular manner to her
poor Heart & in the injoyment of his dearnearness
she went on uninterruptedly, her weakly Constitution
caused her to think she shou'd not have Many years to Spend before


below & in Augst 1761 she got a violent pain in
her side, & was oblige to continue for the Space of
3 months in the Sickroom, so that according to
all appearance many Thought she proably might go
home, which she seam'd Exceeding glad of, but
her recoverying at that Time brought her into Some
concern, for Said She I believe our Savr has not obtaind
his full Aim with me, as yet however I am his
Sinner poor & resignd to the will of my bridegroom
pray I but please his Eyes dear. that is all I wish for,
very Entertaining & 
her simple band like conversation was attended with
a good feeling, Thus she went on in a Close attachment
to her wounded freind on March 27 she got a relasp of
her old disorder & betook herself to the Sickroom again
our Doetnal Day being on the 29. She seem'd very much
troubled in her mind that she cou'd not injoy the Choir oppor
tunities, when ask'd if she believed she shou'd go home
the answer was she did not know for Certain, but had
some small hops, that her bridegroom would not let
her be very Long, as he knows replye'd she what a 
poor Creature I am, & how much I long to be with him
on Good Friday She partook once more of her Lords Corpses
& blood to her unspeakable Joy & consolation, & in these
Embraces the long'd for the Last Kiss But her
dissolution being yet longer then her Expectation
the Sistrs perceived her very thoughtfull for some days
when She with a longing Smart made inquery of


of those that visited her, why our Savr did not
fetch her to himself, 
a fortnight before her
departure she one day discover'd by her cherefull
Look that she now had got the assurance of going
to her belove'd of which she Spoak with great Joy
one cou'd offer hear her converse & pray to our
Savr also thanking Him for what he'd done for
her, & in these meditations she continued till
the 8 of May, were one cou'd preceive her hour
drew near, a Liturgy was keptd by her bed & she
with a faltering Tongue Still days till she Breathd
Forth her Spirit, dureing that verse the Soul of
Christ the Sanchfie, she received the blessing
of her Choir & went over into the Joy of her
Lord about 4 a Clock in the Morning of
May the 8 of 1762.
