<u>Memoir<br />
Of our beloved Sister <persname>Karen Borg</persname>, who<br />
departed to the Lord at <placename>Gracehill</placename>,<br />
<date>March 8 1847</date>.</u><br />
The vice of that blood which<br />
Flowed from thee Saviour!<br />
Which cries aloud wherein I tread<br />
Thy tears for my ransom - all<br />
Plead in my favor,<br />
Nor call for vengeance on my head.<br />
No! grace &amp; free mercy thy looks impart,<br />
And this day refresh me taken my heart.<br />
In spirit thy once bleeding hands I embrace<br />
Which bear me triumphant<br />
Though all my distress.<br />
<br />
This verse contains in it the history of<br />
my course on earth, regarding which I have<br />
nothing remarkable to record; but I would<br />
acknowledge the mercy of our faithful Friend<br />
and Saviour, who sought and found me,<br />
and

.300009.4000092
and has held his gracious hand over<br />
me his poor child.<br />
I was born <date>May 18 1768</date> at <placename>Christiansfeld</placename><br />
in <placename>Norway</placename>, where I was carefully bro<br />
up by my dear parents till my 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year.<br />
I remember where I was only 7 seeing<br />
them weeping, and when I inquired<br />
the cause, my Brother told me that it<br />
was because they were thinking of our<br />
Saviour, and she discoursed to me on<br />
his love to children and to poor sinners<br />
in a way which made a deep impression<br />
on me. _ <date>June 2 1778</date> my dear Mother<br />
brought me hither to <placename>Christiansfeld</placename> for<br />
education. I felt overjoyed on my arri-<br />
val here, though I could not tell why,<br />
but I have since thanked the Lord with<br />
tears a thousand times for choosing<br />
me out of the world and bringing me<br />
to his people. I soon felt myself at<br />
home with my companions, and was<br />
very happy. The children&#39;s prayer class<br />
were days of especial blessing to my<br />
heart. <date><abbr>Febr</abbr> 16 1780</date> I received permis=<br />
year<br />

.300009.4000093
year was <del>permitted</del> added to the choir<br />
of Girls. I felt much on leaving the chil-<br />
dren&#39;s choir, in which I had enjoyed so<br />
much of my Saviour&#39;s nearness, where<br />
we brought him our united supplica-<br />
tions, or when I retired to weep for him<br />
in private. <date>July 9</date> following, I was <abbr>rec</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>d</abbr></hi><br />
into the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>; but having to wait some<br />
time for admission to the Lord&#39;s supper,<br />
I could not understand it, as I had<br />
made it a subject of frequent prayer,<br />
and hitherto the Lord had always heard<br />
me. On reflection, I said it was to teach<br />
me not to trust in my own strength,<br />
or diligence, or virtue, or good educa-<br />
tion, and to wean me from the danger-<br />
ous self complacency which I cherish-<br />
ed on account of these things. And<br />
my faithful Saviour <sic>succeded</sic>&nbsp; <corr>succeeded</corr> in<br />
convincing me that I was possessed<br />
of nothing good.<br />
When I attained to the first enjoy-<br />
ment of the Holy Communion, <date><abbr>Oct</abbr> 10<br />
1782</date>, I felt how blessed it is to be<br />
poor in spirit, and to receive his mer-<br />
its

.300009.4000094
-its as a fit of undeserved grace. I<br />
begged him to preserve me in this frame<br />
of spirit, and to grant me low thoughts<br />
of myself at all times, seeing that to<br />
poor needy sinners he was so gracious.<br />
In this disposition my days passed<br />
happily away, until my innate de-<br />
pravity began to awaken within me.<br />
Hitherto I had often acknowledged<br />
myself a sinful creature, but now<br />
I <u>felt</u> that from the heart proceed<br />
wil thoughts, and sorely was I tor-<br />
mented with un-christianlike<br />
thoughts, so that I had no rest day<br />
nor night. To disclose my trouble to<br />
others, would I thought inevitably<br />
deprive me of their good opinion;<br />
my confidence in my Saviour also<br />
vanished, and I knew not how to<br />
bear myself for distress of mind. In<br />
this pitiable condition, I shut my-<br />
self up in a room alone - it was a<br />
sacrament-day <date><abbr>Dec</abbr> 24 1785</date>, threw<br />
myself at my Saviour&#39;s feet and<br />
begged

.300009.4000095
begged him with a flood of tears to<br />
have mercy on his wandering child,<br />
and give me to feel the pardon of my<br />
sins. And never shall I forget, I trust,<br />
the look of grace with which I was cheer-<br />
ed on this occasion lay my crucified Re-<br />
deemer. It was as though he said to me<br />
himself &quot;I have heard thy prayer and<br />
seen thy tears - thou art mine.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Might all his loving heart but see,<br />
And know his bowels of compassion<br />
To sinners, straying carelessly,<br />
Or such as mourning seek salvation.&quot;<br />
From this time I was like one<br />
new-born; I felt my short-comings in-<br />
deed very frequently, but the Lord inspir-<br />
ed me with faith in Him, so that I<br />
could lay all my wants before Him.<br />
I was also enabled to speak confiden-<br />
tially with my choir-laborer, which<br />
was a great care to me. I now went<br />
on my course, not indeed without va-<br />
riation, yet always finding comfort<br />
and peace at my Saviour&#39;s feet. And his<br />
patience, mercy and compassion are<br />
more

.300009.4000096
more than everything to me.<br />
<date>May 4 1786</date> I was received into<br />
the <abbr>Sgle</abbr>. <abbr>Srs</abbr>. choir, on which occasion<br />
I had an inexpressibly blessed percep-<br />
tion of the Lord&#39;s nearness, and gave<br />
myself up to him anew as his eternal<br />
property, imploring him to keep posses-<br />
sion of my heart, that all his thoughts<br />
of peace with me might be attained.<br />
Towards the end of the same month,<br />
I had the pleasure to see my dear father<br />
here on a visit, and many a pleasing<br />
recollection of the conversation I had<br />
with him on spiritual subjects, is im-<br />
printed on my memory. <date>July 2</date> in the<br />
same year, I received a proposal to as-<br />
sist as teacher in the Girls&#39; school, which<br />
caused me many heavy hours, feeling<br />
as I did my insufficiency and inex-<br />
perience, and knowing that there were<br />
others more suitable for the situation.<br />
The Lord however enabled me to take<br />
the proposal as from His hand, and<br />
helped me graciously through all dif-<br />
ficulties. It is true I had much to<br />
learn

.300009.4000097
learn, and this mere school for my<br />
heart caused me many a sleepless<br />
night. All however worked together for<br />
my good, and calls for my humble<br />
and heartfelt gratitude. My inter-<br />
course with the dear children whom<br />
I cordially loved, and whose love I felt<br />
in return, was very pleasant to me,<br />
and the Lord was after in our midst<br />
in our social worship. When things of<br />
an unpleasant nature occurred, it was<br />
my prayer, that if I could do no good,<br />
I might at least lay no stumbling-block<br />
in the way of these little ones. _<br />
The early part of the year <date>1789</date> was a<br />
peculiarly blessed season for my soul,<br />
my mind being much occupied with<br />
the thought of going home to the Lord.<br />
This idea was greatly strengthened,<br />
when, in the beginning of <date>April</date> I<br />
had an attack of spitting of blood.<br />
Many were the hours of blessed in-<br />
tercourse with the Friend of my soul,<br />
which I enjoyed at this period. Thank<br />
to Thee my faithful Saviour, for the man-<br />
ner

.300009.4000098
in which thou was pleased to<br />
own me, thy poor child: thou hast<br />
followed me with love and tender&nbsp;mer-<br />
cy from my youth up; be my confidence<br />
still, and suffer not my faith to fail,<br />
till the happy hour shall strike which<br />
summons me to meet thee, when I<br />
shall say: &quot;Here comes a sinner who<br />
would fain <abbr>Thro</abbr>&#39; the Lamb&#39;s ransom<br />
entrance gain.&quot; I would rather have<br />
gone home at this time than recovered,<br />
and both mind and body felt the effects<br />
of this illness for a long period. In the<br />
following <date><abbr>Sept</abbr></date>. several things combined<br />
to weigh down my spirits, and every one<br />
thought I was in a decline. As I kept<br />
my trouble to myself, the burden was<br />
the heavier, and I began to doubt my<br />
Saviour&#39;s willingness to help. But he<br />
appeared again to comfort me and put<br />
my anxious grieving to shame. I was<br />
especially cheered at this time, by the<br />
privilege which he vouchsafed[?] me,<br />
of joining in the celebration of the <date>16<br />
of <abbr>Sept</abbr>.</date> with the servants of our Church.<br />
Thus

.300009.4000099
Thus far was written <date><abbr>Nov</abbr>. 1789</date>.<br />
<date><abbr>Jany</abbr> 1 1798</date> was a very blessed New-<br />
years-day to me. The Lord gave me to feel<br />
his forgiveness of all my transgressions<br />
and mistakes so sensibly, that my heart<br />
overflowed with gratitude and joy, and<br />
I devoted myself to his service amongst<br />
the little ones with new courage, heavy<br />
as my situation had been in many<br />
respects in the past year. On the <date>12</date> I<br />
received a call to <placename>Ebersdorf</placename> as Co-labourer<br />
of the <abbr>Sgle</abbr> <abbr>Srs</abbr>. choir, which, notwith-<br />
standing my insufficiency, I ventured<br />
to accept in reliance on the Lord&#39;s help,<br />
which I had experienced on many a&nbsp;<br />
former trial. On casting a retrospective<br />
glance on the 20 years which I have<br />
spent in this dear <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>, I cannot but<br />
adore my Saviour with the deepest hu-<br />
mility and gratitude for his great long-<br />
suffering, patience and faithfulness.<br />
The love and friendship testified towards<br />
me by my sisters, notwithstanding<br />
all my failings, humbled me greatly,<br />
and made the parting painful. Nor<br />
could

.300009.4000100
could I have the dear children commit-<br />
ted to my care without a pang. My sin-<br />
cere wish is that they may all prosper<br />
for the Lord, and yield themselves to<br />
him as his property. On my dear fa-<br />
ther&#39;s happy depature at <date>Christmas<br />
1794</date>, my dear mother removed hither&nbsp;<br />
to my no small gratification and joined<br />
the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi>. I had now to quit her and<br />
all my dear friends, leaving <placename>Christans-<br />
feld</placename> <date>May 5</date>, and on the <date>30</date> of the same<br />
month, I arrived in <placename>Ebersdorf</placename>. I felt<br />
a strange sensation on catching a first<br />
view of the place in the distance, but<br />
I said &quot;Dear Saviour, thou hast called<br />
me hither, and thou must help me.<br />
Thou best knowest my weakness,<br />
I know none here but thee alone, and<br />
thou permitted me to cling to thee.&quot;<br />
Notwithstanding my fears, I was<br />
received with much love. Previous<br />
to my being introduced to the choir,<br />
I cast myself at the feet of Jesus<br />
and besought him with many tears<br />
to be my Guide, and enable me to walk<br />
before

.300009.4000101
before him in lowliness and humility.<br />
I then entered the choir-hall, and never<br />
shall I forget what I felt on being blessed<br />
for my office. It was as if our Saviour<br />
himself laid his pierced hands upon my<br />
head, and gave me his benediction.<br />
What rendered it still more impressive<br />
to me was, that it occurred just at the<br />
entrance upon Passion week. I soon felt<br />
at home in this dear peaceful settlement,<br />
and spent 3 years very happily. The La-<br />
borer and Warden of the choir were two<br />
old experienced sisters, whose counsel and<br />
assistance were of essential service to me.<br />
Their love, as well as the love and confi-<br />
dence of my sisters generally, made my<br />
abode here very pleasant.<br />
<date>March 30 1801</date> I received a call to<br />
<placename>Fulnec</placename>, which was again a hard trial<br />
to me. Gladly would I have declined it<br />
but I did not feel at liberty to do so. I<br />
therefore accepted it in implicit reliance<br />
on my gracious Lord. In May I received<br />
an invitation to be present at the Synod<br />
of the <abbr>Brn&#39;s</abbr> Church, which was to be held<br />
this

.300009.4000102
this year, and found it a means of<br />
new grace and encouragement for<br />
my weak faith.<br />
On the <date>24</date> of the same month, I<br />
took farewell of my choir, dividing with<br />
them the cup of covenant, and next<br />
day proceeded to <placename>Herrnhut</placename>. <date><abbr>Sept</abbr> 3</date> I<br />
pursued my journey in company of<br />
<persname><abbr>Br</abbr>. and <abbr>Sr</abbr>. Moore</persname>, and arrived in <placename>Fulnec</placename><br />
<date>October 3</date>.<br />
Thus far our late sister continued<br />
her memoir in German, though of the<br />
introductory verse she has furnished<br />
both the original and the version. Sever-<br />
al other verses are interspersed in the<br />
memoir, which show her ready talent<br />
in this species of composition.<br />
She continues in English as follows:<br />
<placename><u>Fulnec</u></placename><u>. </u><date><u><abbr>Oct</abbr> 3 1811</u></date><u>.</u><br />
Calling to mind this day, that it is<br />
10 years since I arrived in this place,<br />
various thoughts occupy my mind.<br />
In taking a short view of that period,<br />
I

.300009.4000103
I sink down abased before my Lord and<br />
Saviour, for numberless proofs of his love,<br />
faithfulness and forbearance, which I<br />
have experienced in many ways. The first<br />
year I spent here appeared very heavy in-<br />
deed; everything seemd so different to<br />
what I was accustomed, and not know-<br />
ing the language, was altogether a heavy<br />
task. However my best Friend did not<br />
leave me nor forsake me, but lent a<br />
gracious ear to all my wants and com-<br />
plaints. In <date><abbr>Oct</abbr>. 1802</date> I was afflicted<br />
with an epidemical fever, and so ill,<br />
that little hope was given of my recovery.<br />
Though I had no clearness that I should<br />
go to my dear Saviour, yet I wished<br />
for that favor to see him face to face,<br />
and felt happy in the thought of leav-<br />
ing this world. But it pleased him to<br />
restore me again, and I found much<br />
reason to thank and adore him for<br />
his paternal love and care, which<br />
was made manifest to me.<br />
<date><abbr>Dec</abbr>. 15</date> the same year we celebra-<br />
ted the anniversary of this house

.300009.4000104
50 years ago. This surely was a day<br />
which the Lord himself made; the<br />
blessings we enjoyed will always be<br />
remembered with gratitude by<br />
those who were present; and I can<br />
truly say it was the first day I felt<br />
quite at home here.<br />
In <date>1803</date> and <date>1804</date> it pleased our<br />
Saviour to call home to himself<br />
both my fellow-labourers. This was<br />
a heavy stroke, which was very se-<br />
verely felt by me: but thanks to<br />
my dear Lord, who supported me,<br />
as I now in a way felt as standing<br />
by myself. The love and support<br />
and confidence, which I under these<br />
afflictions experienced from my dear<br />
choir, will never be forgotten by me.<br />
Sinner-tears bedew my cheek now<br />
while I write these lines, and call<br />
to mind numberless proofs of my<br />
Redeemer&#39;s love and patience towards<br />
me, the poorest of the needy; which<br />
my

.300009.4000105
pen cannot relate. Oh! in the dust<br />
I thank and adore him, though I<br />
blush with shame when I look to<br />
myself and see how often I have<br />
greived him in my own course and<br />
what belongs to my office. Oh! my<br />
Saviour, pardon all my neglects<br />
and mistakes; thou knowest my<br />
wants, thou seest my tears; ah! re-<br />
member me who are but dust and<br />
ashes; blot out my sins and transgress-<br />
sions with thy precious blood, and<br />
endou me with new grace to act ac-<br />
cording to thy mind, to be faithful to<br />
my calling, to walk before thee in hu-<br />
mility and loveliness of heart. Strength-<br />
en my confidence in thee, that midst<br />
all trials I may rely unshaken up-<br />
on thy faithfulness.<br />
In <date>1806</date> I had the pleasure to<br />
welcome <persname><abbr>Sr</abbr>. Connor </persname>here, who had<br />
received a call to be Warden of this<br />
choir. With her I have till this day<br />
lived in love and peace, and we<br />
could jointly bear the concerns Com-<br />
mitted

.300009.4000106
mitted to us, which have often been<br />
a subject for prayer and supplication,<br />
but to Him who has thus far in my<br />
trials and heavy circumstances help-<br />
ed through, I commit every concern,<br />
with faith and full assurance that<br />
He as a tender Father, as the friend<br />
of the poor and needy, will in time<br />
to come care for his dear bought fam-<br />
ily and choir, both with spiritual<br />
and temporal blessings. My sincere<br />
prayer is expressed in these lines:<br />
On that day of consummation<br />
May we sinners mercy find;<br />
Saved with complete salvation<br />
And not one be left behind<br />
As wise virgins<br />
May we all before thee stand.<br />
Within these 10 years I have wit-<br />
nessed 39 instances of <abbr>Sgle</abbr>. <abbr>Srs</abbr>. who<br />
happily departed to the Lord. On<br />
such occasions I have often felt<br />
more than I can express. They<br />
have

.300009.4000107
have been solemn opportunities to<br />
examine my own heart before<br />
the Lord; and when I shall have<br />
the favor to see him face to face,<br />
my stammering tongue shall<br />
praise him for these and thous-<br />
and other blessings. I have also<br />
had the pleasure to see several<br />
become useful in our Saviour&#39;s<br />
service; may He still prepare<br />
many to be witnesses of his redeem-<br />
ing love.<br />
<br />
<u><date>August 5 1833</date>.</u><br />
<br />
After a period of 22 years, I<br />
take up my pen once more still<br />
to acknowledge the mercy and<br />
goodness of my dear Saviour.<br />
<date><abbr>Sept</abbr>. 26 1816</date> I received a call<br />
to <placename>Gracehill</placename>, which I accepted in<br />
reliance on the Lord&#39;s help and<br />
support. When I look back on the<br />
period

.300009.4000108
period of 15 years spent in <placename>Fulnec</placename>,<br />
my eyes flow over with gratitude for<br />
the numberless proofs of my faith-<br />
ful Saviour&#39;s love and forbearness<br />
he has proved my Counsellor and<br />
friend, my Advocate to plead my<br />
cause, my Comforter in all trouble.<br />
O that I had been more faithful to<br />
his Spirit&#39;s teaching, and of more use<br />
to those committed to my care. Here<br />
shame fills my inmost soul, and<br />
I can only say &quot;Lord be merciful to<br />
me a sinner! O blot out my sins and<br />
transgressions with thy precious blood<br />
and remember them no more.&quot;<br />
<date><abbr>Dec</abbr> 5</date> I set out for my new post;<br />
the evening before was a meeting for<br />
taking leave of my dear choir, whose<br />
joy and grief were always deeply<br />
felt by me; and my earnest prayer<br />
is and shall be, that the Lord<br />
may keep his protecting hand<br />
over that family and house, and<br />
that his thoughts of peace may be<br />
ob-

.300009.4000109
obtained with every individual soul.<br />
I believe we all felt on that occasion<br />
what is expressed in the hymn:<br />
&quot;Blest be that sacred covenant love to.&quot;<br />
<date><abbr>Dec</abbr>. 10 1816</date> I arrived safe in <placename>Grace-<br />
hill</placename> after a troublesome journey and<br />
voyage, wind and weather being<br />
very severe. I was received in love,<br />
and soon found myself at home;<br />
but finding the house in a very<br />
distressed state with regard to ex-<br />
ternals, it would often sink my<br />
spirits; but thanks to my dear Savi-<br />
our, the giver of my good gift, who<br />
also in this respect has helped us<br />
far above all that we would ask<br />
or think.<br />
This has often been a subject to<br />
me for much gratitude and hu-<br />
miliation. He also inclined the<br />
heart of our much beloved late<br />
<persname>Mr</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>s</persname></hi><persname> Bates</persname>, to lend a helping hand<br />
to our distress, for which no doubt<br />
he will richly reward have. Many<br />
prayers also for the spiritual pros-<br />
perity

.300009.4000110
perity of this choir, and particularly<br />
the younger part, I trust, O Lord,<br />
thou hast heard and when thou<br />
hearest. O forgive - O pardon me<br />
when I have been to a lenient or&nbsp;<br />
too severe. O forgive All - All.<br />
<br />
A loose paper un-dated, adds:<br />
It has often of late been im-<br />
pressed on my mind, that my<br />
time here below may perhaps<br />
not be long, perhaps sudden. This<br />
is an awful meditation, but also<br />
a happy one. I have nothing to say<br />
but the Publican&#39;s plea - &quot;God be<br />
merciful to me a sinner!&quot;<br />
Still I have that divine assur-<br />
ance, that he will receive me in<br />
mercy and cleanse me in that<br />
precious fountain, which by faith<br />
I opened see, and do the me in his<br />
blood and righteousness. O my<br />
Saviour, I am in thy hands, hide<br />
me

.300009.4000111
me till the storm of life is past,<br />
and then I shall be with thee<br />
in evermore. O happy lot.<br />
What heavenly joy and consolation<br />
This hope affords unto my heart to.<br />

Thus far our late Sister has con-<br />
tinued her memoir.<br />
------------------------------------<br />
It was only on the <date>22</date> of last<br />
month that our dear sister was<br />
taken ill, having probably caught<br />
cold on the preceding day where<br />
she was walking in the burial-<br />
ground lane. She was soon obli-<br />
ged to keep her bed, though no<br />
immediate apprehensions were<br />
entertained as to the result. After<br />
a whole week however had elap-<br />
sed, the unabated continuance of<br />
the febrile symptoms, and the to-<br />
tal loss of appetite occasioned by<br />
the

.300009.4000112
the malady, filled our minds with<br />
anxiety, and she herself began to en-<br />
tertain the hope that her Saviour<br />
was about to call her to himself.<br />
On the <date>2 </date>of this month, she quo-<br />
ted the well known lines of <persname>C. Wes-<br />
ley</persname>: _ &quot;O could I catch a smile from thee<br />
And drop into eternity.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said she should be glad to go<br />
to him if it were his pleasure. In reply<br />
to a remark made on the loss which<br />
we should feel if she were removed<br />
from us, she disclaimed all idea of<br />
worthiness in herself; her short-com<br />
ings she said, were many, and she<br />
had nothing to trust to but our Sa-<br />
viour&#39;s merits. On the following day<br />
though very weak so that she had not<br />
spoken all the morning, she rallied<br />
a little when <persname><abbr>Br</abbr>. Edwards</persname> called in<br />
the afternoon, and uttered a few<br />
broken sentences, the purport of<br />
which was, that she longed to go<br />
home soon to be with the Lord.<br />
The

.300009.4000113
The farewell blessing in reference to her<br />
departure, was now given, and her<br />
dear bought soul recommended to the<br />
hands of her Redeemer, who had led<br />
her so graciously throughout her<br />
course, and made her so rich a<br />
means of blessing to others. She<br />
was again favored with an inter-<br />
val of consciousness on the 6th (Sat-<br />
urday last) and requested her <sic>visiter</sic>&nbsp; <corr>visitor</corr><br />
to pray with her. From that time&nbsp;<br />
she gradually sunk away, until on<br />
<date>Monday the 8</date> it pleased the Lord<br />
to release her from her worn-out ta-<br />
bernacle in a very gentle manner,<br />
and translate her who the presence<br />
of his glory with exceeding joy _<br />
Her age was 78 3/4 years.<br />
There is no need for us to en-<br />
large on the character of our late<br />
justly beloved and venerated sister.<br />
Her praise is in all the Churches,<br />
and her works do follow her _<br />
We have lost in her a Mother in our<br />
spiritual <placename>Israel</placename>, who was truly and<br />
deeply

deeply intrusted in the welfare of<br />
the <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> collectively and individ-<br />
ually. Consecrated to the Lord from<br />
early infancy, she spent a long life<br />
in fellowship of spirit with her<br />
Saviour, and accounted it a privi-<br />
lege to serve him with all the power<br />
and faculties which he had given<br />
her. What above all distinguished<br />
her character and made her so emi-<br />
nently useful in his church, was<br />
the large measure of the spirit of<br />
love, which was poured out upon<br />
her. Her service as choir-laborer<br />
in <placename>Ebersdorf</placename>, <placename>Fulnec</placename> and <placename>Gracehill</placename>,<br />
will long be treasured in the recollection<br />
of those who were favored to enjoy her<br />
kind and faithful care. By far the<br />
greater portion of her life has been<br />
dedicated to active service in the family<br />
of Christ below. Not to mention her<br />
services as Teacher for for 11 1/2 years, her<br />
labors in her own choir comprise a<br />
period of 48 years from her entrance<br />
on

on office as Co-laborer at <placename>Ebersdorf</placename> to<br />
her final resignation on account of<br />
increasing infirmity in <date><abbr>Nov</abbr>. 1845</date>.<br />
It may be truly said of her, that it was<br />
her greatest happiness to do good, and<br />
the manner in which she performed<br />
her deeds of kindness, made them<br />
still more valuable. Humility, indeed,<br />
was likewise a very leading feature<br />
in her character, and nothing would<br />
have distressed her more than the<br />
thought of being made the subject<br />
of eulogy. Still, it is meet to acknow-<br />
ledge the grace of God and the un-<br />
feigned faith which dwelt in her<br />
so much, and to set before our minds<br />
for invitation, the humility, simplicity<br />
and love, which graced her walk and<br />
conversation, as she went in and out<br />
amongst us.<br />
We may still admit to her sincere<br />
and steady love for the Lord&#39;s house<br />
and ordinances. His place in Church<br />
was never vacant, when she was<br />
able to venture out; and to stay<br />
away

away from the meetings, was a depri-<br />
vation and a grief to her. On the<br />
Thursday after she was seized with<br />
her last illness, she expressed her<br />
regret at being debarred this priv-<br />
ilege and repeated the first line<br />
of the verse, <abbr>N</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>o</abbr></hi> 732 _<br />
One wish with holy transport warm<br />
My heart hath formed &amp; still doth form<br />
One gift I ask, that to my end<br />
Thine hallowed house I may attend to<br />
She&nbsp; is now more highly favored<br />
in being admitted to the great <abbr>Cong</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi><br />
and the true sanctuary. May we<br />
follow her path, and so, through<br />
grace, be permitted to share her<br />
happiness!
