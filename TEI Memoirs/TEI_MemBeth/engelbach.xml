                  <lb />I was born the <date>24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1709</date> at <placeName>Auenheim</placeName> a Village near 
                  <lb />the <placeName>Rhine</placeName>, in which Place my Father was Parson. My Mothers maiden 
                  <lb />Name was <persName>Michaelis</persName> and descended from <placeName>Polish Lissa</placeName>. In the year <date>1711</date>
                  <lb />myself and a younger Brother was deprived of our Father in our Tenderesh
                  <lb />Infancy. After 3 years Widdowhood my Mother Married an Intendant of the
                  <lb/>Finaces named <del>Aulber</del> <persName><corr>Aulber</corr> </persName>who removed in the year <date>1716</date> to <placeName>Bussweiler</placeName>
                  <lb/>where he became <sic>Councellor</sic> <corr>Counselor</corr> of the Finaces. Here I was sent to the 
                  <lb/>Gymnasium where I saw and heard much evil, and as I grew older became 
                  <lb />sensible of the Hurt it was to me, myself my own Brother, my Step Brother and 
                  <lb />a Relation of ours a <sic>Minesters</sic> <corr>Ministers</corr> Son, soon found out that we was utterly corrupt= 
                  <lb />ed children. We 4 <abbr>join'd</abbr> together in a <del>Resolution</del> to give our Hearts to the Lord 
                  <lb />Jesus, often we rose before day, went out into the Fields, <sic>kneelt</sic> <corr>knelt</corr> down on our

                  <lb />in our Minds to go into the thickest <sic>Forrest</sic> <corr>Forest</corr> to feed on grass and pray day 
                  <lb />and Night, that our poor Souls might be saved; But the severe and cruel 
                  <lb />treatment we met with from our Masters shifted every thing. It is true 
                  <lb />that from time to time, we often felt anew the drawings of divine grace 
                  <lb />and I remember with shame and Bowedness, what my heart felt whenever 
                  <lb />I read or heard any thing of our Saviour and his bleeding wounds, that 
                  <lb />presently melted my heart and Draw tears from my Eyes; Yet the <hi rend="underline"> in=

                  <lb />to render my Conversion an Impossibility. Therefore I thought I would

                  <lb />his Mercy at the End of all Distress, as he did the Penitent Thief. In the
                  <lb />Year <date>1726</date> I was sent to the University at <placeName>Strassburg</placeName>; In the year <date>1727</date>
                  <lb />to <placeName>Jena</placeName> and <date>1728</date> to <placeName>Wittenberg</placeName>. Here that Corruption broke loose like
                  <lb />a Deluge, which had hither to been <abbr>restrain'd</abbr> by the Laws Severity,
                  <lb />and I ran blindly into Sin, the wages of which quickly <abbr>follow'd</abbr>; some=
                  <lb />=times I wept and cried to Jesus for deliverance, but Sin became still
                  <lb />more Sinful, till at length I was <sic>litterally</sic> <corr>literally</corr> the express Picture of
                  <lb />the Prodigal Son! and in the Year <date>1730</date> I actually set out for home
                  <lb />with these Thoughts: I will return to my severe Step Father; he may if
                  <lb />he pleases make me his Servant! To such a pass I was come!
                  <lb />Oh thou Merciful Lamb! thou has taken a poor Creature indeed to
                  <lb />thy Mercy! I was immediately put under the care of a Man who
                  <lb />had formerly been our House Preceptor, but was now become Parson
                  <lb />in a Country Village, who continued his usual rigorous treatment of
                  <lb />me. At length I grew weary of the distress which Sin occasioned
                  <lb />humbled myself, and <abbr>beg'd</abbr> the Lord Jesus for support, would fain
                  <lb />have been converted but knew not where to begin, and to my Sor
                  <lb />=row had no one to Inform me. I came into works, <abbr>pray'd</abbr> and
                  <lb />wept, yet sin not being brought under <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> the Blood of Jesus con
                  <lb />=tinued to rage the more in heart. In the year <date>1731</date> I was sent
                  <lb />to the Seminary of the Candidates to the Pastoral Office and was
                  <lb />a Teacher in the Gynmnasium. O that I had but then been ac
                  <lb />=quainted with my Bleeding Redeemer perhaps I should have been
                  <lb />of Service to the Youth under my care as they all loved me.
                  <lb />In the Year <date>1733</date> I <abbr>receivd</abbr> ordination to a Preacher of the <sic>Gosple</sic> <corr>Gospel</corr>
                  <lb />and in the Year <date>1734</date> was introduced as Deacon at <placeName>Ingweiler</placeName>
                  <lb />and teacher at <placeName>Ripperhweiler</placeName>. The office of a Teacher was weighty
                  <lb />to me, I was <sic>truely</sic> <corr>truly</corr> Sensible of my <sic>unworthyness</sic> <corr>unworthiness</corr> and <sic>innability</sic> <corr>inability</corr>
                  <lb />knew not which way to turn, <abbr>pray'd</abbr> frequent and fervently and
                  <lb />yet continued unconverted, was forever Restless wept in private
                  <lb />before the Lord Jesus and <abbr>beg'd</abbr> for Mercy; my poor <abbr>distress'd</abbr>
                  <lb />heart <abbr>cleav'd</abbr> to him, and nothing was more pleasing to me than
                  <lb />to preach of his Death and bleeding wounds, which I <sic>allways</sic> <corr>always</corr> did

                  <lb />with great Emotion, well knowing nothing but Jesus blood and wounds
                  <lb />could sanctifyme poor wretched and corrupted Man; and I experi=
                  <lb />=enced, that the word of his Suff'rings was thunder which <sic>shoock</sic> <corr>shook</corr>
                  <lb />my Soul and the Souls of my hearers. After I had been 16 Weeks at
                  <lb /><placeName>Ingweiler</placeName>, I <abbr>receiv'd</abbr> a call to <placeName>cron=Weissenburg</placeName>, I should have gone
                  <lb />thither a year before, but as I was only <abbr>ask'd</abbr> <sic>wether</sic> <corr>whether</corr> I had a Mind
                  <lb />to go there, and was not duely voted I thought I was free to refuse,
                  <lb />and parson <persName>Heinold</persName> came there in my stead. I had rather have
                  <lb /><abbr>stay'd</abbr> in a Mean Village and known to few, but as I <abbr>observ'd</abbr> it was
                  <lb />the Lords will, I concluded to accept the call, <sic>altho</sic> <corr>although</corr> I should follow
                  <lb />my dear Step Brother <hi rend="underline"><persName>Aulbern</persName></hi> to his grave, who had been senior <persName>Aulber</persName>
                  <lb />in that city and <abbr>dy'd</abbr> in the Epedemical Fever which then <abbr>rag'd</abbr>
                  <lb />there. With the disposition of heart and Mind I went thither in
                  <lb /><date>February 1735</date>. The largeness of the City, the number of Sick and
                  <lb />abundance of Labour I saw prepared for me made me Tremble, and I
                  <lb />shall never forget with what a feeling, and with how many Tears I <sic>entred</sic> <corr>entered</corr>
                  <lb />into my office. In <date>April 1756</date> I married my Step <abbr>B.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>r</abbr></hi> <persName>Shillers</persName> <sic>Widdow</sic> <corr>Widow</corr>
                  <lb />I knew not how to conduct myself according to our Saviours Mind in a
                  <lb />Married State, notwithstanding we lived cheerful and happy together
                  <lb />in our way, and every Body regarded us as a Happy Pair. In
                  <lb /><date>February 1737</date> our Saviour gave us a Daughter <persName>Marie Margaretta</persName>
                  <lb />and 13 Months after took her to himself in the Small Pox. In
                  <lb />the same Year a Neghbouring Doctor of Physick sent me a
                  <lb />Treatise against the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> Hymns. I <abbr>look'd</abbr> it <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> and was for
                  <lb />the first time convinced that <add>such</add> a people existed. At first I thought
                  <lb />these are <persName>Schwenkfields</persName> descendants, if their doctrine is false, it
                  <lb />will evaporate Gods Word, and Luthers doctrine will never be
                  <lb /><abbr>abolish'd</abbr>. But I found so much of Jesus Blood and Wounds in
                  <lb />these Hymns, that I was quite doubtful what to think, yea <add>was</add> quite
                  <lb />confused for I could not remember that I had ever read in Church
                  <lb />History of a People that <sic>keept</sic> <corr>kept</corr> to the word of Jesus Patience.

                  <lb />and as my poor Heart, notwithstanding its Corruption was always
                  <lb /><abbr>soften'd</abbr> and my Eyes swam in Tears whenever I read of Jesus <abbr>Suffring</abbr>
                  <lb />for the Sins of the World, I felt the same Emotion at reading these Hymns
                  <lb />and had a desire to hear more of these people, and this I <abbr>obtain'd</abbr>
                  <lb />by means of my dear deceased Uncle <sic>Councellor</sic> <persName><corr>Counselor</corr> Engelbach</persName> who
                  <lb />was in <sic>Connexion</sic> <corr>Connection</corr> with the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: I intreated him to send a <abbr>Br</abbr>.
                  <lb />to me and in the year <date>1749</date> Old <persName>Brother Gold</persName> came at My Request
                  <lb />to my House on his Journey <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> Our City. This Simple Country
                  <lb />Man was a great Blessing to me. He <abbr>look'd</abbr> cheerful and happy, that
                  <lb />I was not, and myself made confidence in Jesus <sic>Merrits</sic> <corr>Merits</corr> would not
                  <lb />stand the Test, nor quiet the uneasiness of my heart. After this
                  <lb />the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: freqeuntly <abbr>calld</abbr> to see me and when they was gone my
                  <lb />Conclusion was I am not like them, I do not know our Saviour.
                  <lb />I wept and <abbr>pray'd</abbr> and <abbr>conferr'd</abbr> with my Colleague <persName>Pastor Reinold</persName> but
                  <lb /><abbr>receiv'd</abbr> poor comfort, often I <abbr>stretch'd</abbr> myself in the Dust and
                  <lb /><abbr>beg'd</abbr> our Saviour to look graciously on me, but in the Midst
                  <lb />of my groans and Lamentations <add>it was</add> as <sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> a Voice within me said
                  <lb />arise, you are not in Earnest, If I give you Honour, and leave you
                  <lb />in your High Life, then I may be your Saviour of choice, but it
                  <lb />would not suit you to forgo all things for my sake, so as I have
                  <lb />for your sake. I felt the Truth of this Reproach, and must be
                  <lb />Silent. Mean time the uneasiness of my Soul still <abbr>increas'd</abbr>
                  <lb />I began to mourn and lament again, but as it <sic>allways</sic> <corr>always</corr> turns
                  <lb />out Fruitless; the Enemy put it in my Mind that I was a
                  <lb />cast away, our Saviour neither would, nor could be Merciful
                  <lb />to such a sinner. This went so far that I was actually be=
                  <lb />=tween Atheism and Desperation. I could no longer Pray
                  <lb />but wherever I <abbr>turn'd</abbr> cried out: Oh Jesu Oh Jesu! The <date>26<hi rend="superscript">>th</hi>
                     <lb />   of October 1744</date> when my distress <abbr>seemd</abbr> to be at the highest
                  <lb />Pitch, I was reading the French News Paper, and all at once
                  <lb />I was struck with these words which <abbr>seemd</abbr> as <sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> they was
                  <lb />spoke in my heart: canst thou read that, and hast no
                  <lb />Saviour
                  <lb /><note type="catchword">This</note>
                  
                  <pb type="double_right"/>
                  
                  <lb />This <abbr>shock'd</abbr> me so, that I let the Paper fall out of my Hands and
                  <lb />fell after it to the Earth. I had no utterance for words, but wept
                  <lb />for Mercy, and gave myself <sic>intirely</sic> <corr>entirely</corr> up to our Saviour without
                  <lb />the least limitation, that with me he might do, whats pleasing
                  <lb />in his sight, and from me take <sic>whatere</sic> <corr>whatever</corr> he will, <sic>whatere</sic> <corr>whatever</corr> he
                  <lb />thinks not right. To me it was as <sic>tho</sic> <corr>though</corr> I then <abbr>receiv'd</abbr> permission
                  <lb />to kiss the Prints of the Nails in his sacred Feet! I felt a Di=
                  <lb />=vine assurance of the forgiveness of my Sins, and <add>the</add> covenant I then
                  <lb />made, is still sure and firm, my heart is no longer mine, but His.
                  <lb />I shall not say much of what <abbr>follow'd</abbr> this change. The want of
                  <lb />a true poor Sinner heart often <abbr>caus'd</abbr> me to commit great failings.
                  <lb />The <abbr>Awaken'd</abbr> Souls keeping to me, Brought on <add>me</add> the displeasure of the
                  <lb />School Master, My Colleague, the Mayor of the City and all the Mages=
                  <lb />=tracy of the Lutheran Side, One Honest <sic>Councellor</sic> <corr>Counselor</corr> excepted. The
                  <lb />Process at <placeName>Strassburg</placeName> <persName>D.</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>r</persName></hi><persName>Froereisen</persName> would have me <abbr>turn'd</abbr> out of my
                  <lb />Office by the Civil Magistrates, and so it went on, till the year <date>1748</date>.
                  <lb />Mean time our Saviour gave me more <sic>oppertunitys</sic> <corr>opportunities</corr> of becoming acquainted
                  <lb />with the <abbr>Brn</abbr>: and in the year <date>1747</date> I made a 12 days visit at
                  <lb /><placeName>Herrnhaag</placeName> to my great Blessing. I was soon convinced that I be=
                  <lb />=longed to this People, but how, or when, my dear Saviour would
                  <lb />bring me thither, that I did not dare to Consider on, this I knew;
                  <lb />it must <sic>thro</sic> <corr>through</corr> a Miracle, otherwise it could not come to Pass. After
                  <lb />this Blessed Visitation, the Enemy grew more <sic>inraged</sic> <corr>engraged</corr>, and I became
                  <lb />a detestation to the whole City except the <abbr>Awakend</abbr> Souls; but my
                  <lb />heart was <sic>chearful</sic> <corr>cheerful</corr> and happy, I supplicated and <abbr>obtain'd</abbr> of my
                  <lb />dear Lord a Promise, which was a great Consolation to me. In <date>Au=
                     <lb />   =gust 1749</date> my dear Wife took to her Bed, and in this her last Ill=
                  <lb />=ness she felt she was a wretched Sinner, <abbr>begd</abbr> for Mercy and openly
                  <lb /><abbr>confess'd</abbr> she had sought the World more than our Saviour, and
                  <lb />fell asleep with this fervent wish: Shelter my Soul most gra=

                  <lb />as I <abbr>observ'd</abbr> above, I had <abbr>obtain'd</abbr> a promise from our dear Saviour
                  <lb />that I should come to his People, but that did not come to pass till
                  <lb />the year <date>1756</date>. In the year <date>1751</date> I came to <placeName>Treweiler</placeName> as Chaplain
                  <lb />and Inspector. Here at length the Hour of my deliverance
                  <lb />struck. I was severly taken to task for my <sic>Conexion</sic> <corr>Connection</corr> with the <abbr>Brns</abbr>
                  <lb /><abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> and after several storms I was required to seperate myself
                  <lb />from them, to quit The Herrnhuters Errors, to deny the People of
                  <lb />God and condemn their Doctrine. This I could not do, but chose
                  <lb />rather to bear the Reproach of Christ and was also removed, and
                  <lb />sat out for <placeName>Newwied</placeName> in the Year <date>1756</date>. Here I became partak-
                  <lb />=er of the <abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> Grace and the same year attaind to the Parti=

                  <lb /><abbr>Cong.</abbr><hi rend="superscript"><abbr>n</abbr></hi> The Next Year I <abbr>receiv'd</abbr> a Call from the Countess to
                  <lb />be her Chaplain and to preach a Sermon every Sunday at
                  <lb />her <sic>Chapple</sic> <corr>Chapel</corr>, which I accepted with the Consent of my <abbr>Brn</abbr>:
                  <lb />and continued in this office <sic>untill</sic> <corr>until</corr> the year <date>1759</date> In which year
                  <lb />I attended the Disciples Household which spent some weeks to
                  <lb />all and Particularly to my great Blessing at <placeName>Newwied</placeName> and went
                  <lb />with them to <placeName>Holland</placeName>. Shortly before Christmas I <abbr>returnd</abbr> with the

                  <lb />in which during an abode of near 4 years I have had the Happiness
                  <lb />to enjoy Numberless Blessings and <sic>Benifits</sic> <corr>Benefits</corr>.
