The following B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. & Sisters have departed
   their Life in this Month.

         The following is her own Account.
I am born the <date>27</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of Jan. 1745</date> at <placename>Lindheim</placename>.
in the third Year of my Age I came in the
Anstalt where I was happy & nimble.
In the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Year I had by a <sic>Baptising</sic>  <corr>Baptizing</corr>  of a Child, 
the first Feeling of our Saviour in my Heart.
Since that I <sic>intented</sic>  <corr>intended</corr>  to love him & <add>to</add> become a good
Child, & had by that means many happy Hours, but
my Selfminded Temper disturbed my Peace very
often & <sic>exerciced</sic>  <corr>exercised</corr>  my Sisters, which conferred all their
Love & <sic>Patiens</sic>  <corr>Patience</corr>  upon me. <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1751</date> As the whole

Anstalt was to move from <placename>Weteravia</placename> to <placename>Hhuth</placename>,
then my Parents <sic>toock</sic>  <corr>took</corr>  me home to <placename>Lindheim</placename>
again. This cost me many Tears & I could't be
accustomd <add>to live here</add> a long while. My Parents took me for
a good Child, & I took Care not to <sic>loose</sic>  <corr>lose</corr>  this good
Credit they had for me. I begun <add>to be</add> proud, took myself
for good <sic>to</sic>  <corr>too</corr>, but my poor <add>Heart</add> grew dry & indifferent
towards our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. at last I became disobedient
towards my Parents & quite reverse to my former
Disposition, so that they was at a loss what to do
with me. In this Condition my Heart was rest-
less & this continued till <date>1755</date>. On good <sic>Fryday</sic>  <corr>Friday</corr>  as
my dear Parents very emphatically remembred to me
what our good Lord suffered & did for me, this <add>brought</add> me to
consider, how miserable I have <add>ever since</add> <unclear>Slandereth</unclear> my noble
Time away. This <sic>emberrassd</sic>  <corr>embarrassed</corr>  my very Soul & I deplord
to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. many Tears to forgive my Sins & bestow
Mercy on me anew, that I may feel his Nearness again.
Hereby I experienced how soon our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. is inclined
to draw near to his poor Worms & to forgive their
Sins & Iniquity. 
From this Day I had began a new Period of my Life,
I had many happy Discourses in my Silence with my
Saviour, for all that I sometimes <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr>  my dry &
indifferent Heart. The Discourses <sic>deleiverd</sic>  <corr>delivered </corr> to the Children
I could never hear without a reproach in my Heart,
& a Wish or Desire for a Opportunity to employ any
Children Years in such a happy Situation. I thought
it very hard for me to stay at home & desireth my

Parents to assist me in this my Wish. Our Savr. supported
my Desire & I got Leave & came to my great Satis-
faction the <date>15</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. Sept. 1756</date> on in <placename>Herrnhuth</placename>. Some Days
after <sic>myn</sic>  <corr>my </corr> Arrival I came in my Choir-House & lived
there very happy, <sic>thancked</sic>  <corr>thanked </corr> our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. very often that he
brought me again in the Congregation. By the removal
in our new Choir-House, the <date>18</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. Octob.</date> & the Pedelavium
the same Day, I receivd a new Blessing, Our <sic>Seviour</sic>  <corr>Saviour</corr>
absolved me anew & I put myself in his His Hand as 
his own Property w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. a <sic>heartely</sic>  <corr>heartily</corr>  Desire to form & make
me according to his Hearts Desire.
The <date>6</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of Dec.</date> I was receiv<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. into the Congregation, I was
from all my Heart ashamed about all the Blessings which
our dear Lord bestowed on such a poor <sic>Siner</sic>  <corr>Sinner</corr>; now my
incessant Wish was: a true Love in my Heart towards
his <sic>Waunts</sic>  <corr>Wants</corr>  & a continual Feeling of his Nearness.
In the Time following I had <add>many</add> happy Conversations w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 
our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. & languishd very often in my Solitude after
the holy <sic>Comunion</sic>  <corr>Communion</corr>! This Grace he bestowed sooner on
poor me as I could expect it, then the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of July
1757</date>. I heard the good Tiding that I was <sic>Candidat</sic>  <corr>Candidate</corr> 
& the <date>31 of Augs.</date> I received our Lords Supper the
first Time! Now was my Desire <add>to enjoy</add> the Effect of his
Flesh & Blood to enjoy in my poor Soul & Body.
Our Saviour was very <sic>gratious</sic>  <corr>gracious</corr> to me & I had after-
wards happy Days & Hours & when I <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> my <sic>naturel</sic>  <corr>natural</corr>
dry & indifferent <add>Heart</add> & had <add>no</add> rest & <sic>weapt</sic>  <corr>wept</corr> so long after
the only Friend of my Soul till I <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> his blessed

Nearness again. Now a new Scene was drawn
up in my Heart: I begun to feel, that I was not
sincere & upright, I did not like to see so much
in my <sic>Uncleaness</sic>  <corr>Uncleanness</corr> in my Heart, I was afraid for
myself, & ashamed to tell a Body of. For all that
I begged to our Saviour to discover every Thing
what is in me & help me to a upright & true
Heart. My Labourers very tenderly reachd me
their Hands and assisted me and made me Courage
to give <add>over</add> every Thing what not will stand the Proof.
I deploreth by my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. to starve thro' his Flesh &
Blood what's unJesuslike & make me a Jesus-
like Girl. So far she herself in the Begin of
<date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1760.</date>
From that Time She lernt herself better <add>to</add> know, grew
open & free towards her Labourers & became a tender
& <sic>sinerlike</sic>  <corr>sinnerlike</corr> Heart towards our Saviour.
In her Outward Behaviour not easily any Thing could
be found to be censured, but her <sic>timerous</sic>  <corr>timorous</corr> & <sic>bakward-</sic>  <corr>backward-</corr>
keeping Temper caused <add>to</add> herself many melancholic
Hours. However our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. did in this respect very
much on her Heart; & She brought away her time very
happy & easy.
<date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1762 the 4</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of May</date>: She was received & according
to her Desire blessed into the Sggle Sister Choir, to
the great Joy of her Heart & She went over wth. a comfor-
ted Heart into her new Choir. Her last Births-Day
the <date>27</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of January</date>

was a Day of Praise to her, especially the Watch-Words
were a great <sic>Rejoysing</sic>  <corr>Rejoicing</corr> to her: Du hast meine Klage
verwandelt in einen Reigen. o du in Freuden-Oel
verwandler meiner Zährlein! She declard, she never
had such Watchwords in her Life on her Birth-Day.
In the <date>Beginning of Febr.</date> a <sic>gallaping</sic>  <corr>galloping</corr> Consumption
sized upon her to the great <sic>Surprice</sic>  <corr>Surprise</corr> of herself & every
Body who knowd her. She was <add>before</add> a <sic>heathy</sic>  <corr>healthy</corr> & brisk Girl,
& on a sudden changed to the great Surprise of every
One. She was directly ready & set upon to go Home
& <sic>possitively</sic>  <corr>positively</corr> declared to hear of nothing else. Her
Sickness <sic>encreaseth</sic>  <corr>increaseth</corr> daily, but She was happy & <sic>allert</sic>  <corr>alert</corr>
with her fellow Sisters, but sometimes She was
observed in the most happy Meditations & Conversation
w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. her <sic>Sev</sic><hi rend="superscript"><sic>r</sic></hi><sic>.</sic>  <corr>Sav</corr><hi rend="superscript"><corr>r</corr></hi><corr>.</corr> & that so deep, that She was not
present to herself & nobody could interrupt her.
When She recoverd again her Y Joy was inexpressible
about her Prospect to be expected. <unclear>A!</unclear> said She one
times, how it is to me I can't tell, when I think a
few Weeks past, I was as healthy a Girl as any One
of you, & now I see myself a <sic>Canditat</sic>  <corr>Candidate</corr> to go to my
dearest Friend! I am full of Joy & Wonder!
The <date>30</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of April</date> She became so weak that She
was forced to keep to her Bed, but thought herself to go
the next Day to go to her Work again. However
it soon discovereth itself that She would not rise
