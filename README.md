The Moravian Lives project is a major international multi-institutional public humanities research initiative. Its objective is to make accessible fully searchable machine-readable texts of over 60,000 memoirs of men and women in the Moravian worldwide congregation from 1750-200. These documents are significant because they comprise a massive corpus of archival information that has until now been inaccessible (due to storage in private archives around the world. Making these texts - and the metadata associated with them will allow scholars, students, and the general public with new ways to analyze this unique dataset.
